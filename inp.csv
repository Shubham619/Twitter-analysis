"Hello. I noticed today that the Youtube app stopped working properly. The model is UA43K5300. It starts, shows the videos thumbnails, but when I click any video, the Loading text pops up and the screen goes black. By moving the arrow keys, I noticed, the video didn't load at all as the user interface of the video is still intact with the total time of the video stuck at 0:00. All the other buttons work fine. Sometimes, if I click on the next video in that screen, the video plays. I checked if there is a system update on the TV or not and it said no update. Please, kindly solve the issue."
"I recently bought the i10 tws and using them with other devices (PC, tablet) I never had any bluetooth communication problems except on my Samsung Galaxy A50, when I listen to music at home by connecting to the WI-FI the signal is transmitted fine and uninterrupted, things change when I use mobile data, the signal continues to skip tenuousness even when attached to the ear. I tried everything, I searched on the internet and I found nothing, I changed the SIM from slot 1 to 2 and even there nothing I reset WI-FI, mobile data and bluetooth settings and nothing changes I emptied the cache I tried to interrupt so many services that I thought could bother the connection and nothing I'm desperate I don't know what to do. Please help me  (If I wrote something wrong, I don't know English well and I'm using Google Translate)"

"My Galaxy A7 (2018) that I bought in January did not receive a single update to this day.  This mid-range phone costs €350 and it is unnaceptable that Samsung hasn't updated the LUX models of this phone.     I do not care about One Ui or pie, but my phone is runnig on a security patch from 2018, I expected better from Samsung."

"Hello All    I have read that others (non S10 variant users) have had problems with the wallet cover not working when updating to Android Pie. I purchased the wallet cover and the only time the LED display is on is when the app is turned on or after opening and closing the flip cover. Is this just a problem I am experiencing or has anyone else experienced the issue?    Is there a fix for this? If it is an issue, I cant believe the Samsung Store (UK) knowingly sold me this case knowing there is a problem and it does not function like it should.    Thanking you in advance."

"Hello,  Does anyone know if its possible to attach the QE55Q7FN central stand to a QE55Q6FN?    Reason I ask is that the feet on the Q6 are too wide for my cabinet and I like the design of the Q7 one.  I'm hoping there is a bracket available to utilise the VESA mounts?"
"Okay, so I am asking them about updating my Galaxy Watch to the new One UI update, and they seem to try to educate me that the watch doesn't run on android One UI, and that it runs on Tizen 4. They have no idea what is going on with your software, and they should be the support. Just give the the email of the developers so I can at least talk to someone that knows what is doing, not just saying stuff to make me stop asking. Here is a screen shot it is in Bulgarian, just translate it. Unacceptable. The works thing is that reporting a software issue made them request my device to be sent to a service center?!?! Wow!"
"After the latest firmware update of the KS8000 to 1233 youtube only starts once correctly with all the clip-suggestions etc. When I shut down the tv via remote and restart youtube opens, however the clips aren't there. It's all black and I cannot open any.  At the moment there is only one solution and that is to take the tv of the power completely and then after 10 seconds put it back and start the tv.    In case someone wonders for what I've tried so far: deinstall Youtube and put it back freshly, also reset the Hub (which was a lot of work, cause one needs to initiate all those programs like amazon, netflix and youtube, as well as other little details)  Also changed from WIFI to network cable...  Nothing has helped.    I wished one could downgrade but that of course is not possible either. Any solution...?"

"I've had my Tab A since Christmas 2017, and never had much of a problem with it. It's only done this once before, but shutting it down for a while and turning it on again solved it. This time it hasn't. Every single app closes (or tries to, in the case of Autodesk Sketchbook, because it asks if I want to exit first) ten seconds or less after I open it. I can't even Google anything longer than 3 words because my keyboard closes automatically, and Chrome has even gone back multiple pages, and then closed when it gets back to the new tab page. Sliding down to see all my apps does it too. I've literally watched it slide up on it's own not even two seconds after sliding down. According to my settings, everything is up to date, so idk what the heck is going on."

"Hello, I have a Gear S3 and used to have an LG K8. Everything worked fine. Now I switched to a Samsung A50, and I have huge issues with maintaining a stable connection between the S3 and the A50. At moments, it disconnects from bluetooth, stays disconnected for about a minute and reconnects. Quite often, the Gear app shows all the options of the watch (as if it is connected), except for the data on battery, storage and memory. During this time, the bluetooth settings of the phone still show the watch as &quot;connected for calls&quot;. This disconnection can happen 10 times in one hour, everytime with the notifications on both watch and phone. But at times I can go for 5 hours without it happening. It happens both when neither are used or when one or both are used. I'm waiting still for the May update to the A50 (the April update came here 2 weeks after it was launched) and for OneUI update for the S3 (I'm expecting also about 2 weeks delay for that one). I hope these updates will fix it, but it was stable with the other phone. All software is at the latest versions (system tells me there are no updates). Any idea on what to try? The constant notifications are driving me nuts... I know I can switch them off, but it was so convenient to know whether or not I left my phone somewhere... I have reset the watch a couple of times (even without putting back a backup) and have reset the phone a couple of times."
"Hello.    I offered a Galaxy Watch Active to my wife on mother's Day but it seems we are having some problems receiving notifications on the watch. The watch is paired with and iPhone SE. I'm aware that there are some limitations in pairing it with an Apple device, like not being able to reply to notifications in the watch, but in all the videos I saw pairing it with an iPhone none of them had this problem.    The problem is that it doesn't receive neither SMS, WhatsApp or email notifications. But the weirdest thing is that receive notifications of an incoming call or a system message, for example when it's time to go to bed the iPhone received a message remembering that, and that message appears in the watch.Another issue is that in the app list of the Galaxy Watch app, in the place where we can manage the notifications, only appears the weather app. Not Gmail, not WhatsApp, any app at all apart from the weather app    I already try to paired it with an Android device and works fine, all the notifications are shown. I already checked and rechecked all the permissions, I already reinstall the galaxy watch app, I already made an hard reset to the watch but nothing seems to work.    Does anyone have any information on how to solve this or anyone have the same problem that can give me some intel? Would be great.    Thanks!"
"Does anyone know where user feedback can be sent to the devs of the actual Good Lock modules, as this seems to be more of a community chat area rather than a development forum?  I'd like to request the very obvious (albeit legacy) 'Menu' button as an option currently missing in NavStar - alongside some of the largely useless extra ones that they do provide. I've always had (or created) a physical menu button at the bottom of my phones, located where I can get at it quickly and easily with one hand, and I still have no intention of bowing to Google's trendy Material Design nonsense about Menus really being 'Overflow Lists' floating somewhere around the screen if you can find them.  Also, I'd like to see a new module to adjust physical button actions - particularly to use three-button cabled headsets for changing tracks/albums with MEDIA_NEXT and MEDIA_PREVIOUS events (as per many other non-Samsung devices) instead of altering the volume for which I already have perfectly usable buttons on the phone itself. It used to be really easy on my previous Samsung devices to simply edit the Generic.kl keyboard layout file (needs root) but it would be lovely to have a simple (and Pie-friendly) way to do it on my new Galaxy A70.  If those two options were available, I finally think I can live with a mobile device without rooting it, which would be a first for me.    Andre"
"OK, so I've decided to sell my S3 Frontier, unless there's a way to solve the insistence on connecting via Bluetooth. Since the latest update to Tizen 3.0 it looks like Samsung have made it more difficult to use without it being connected 24/7 to an Android device via Bluetooth, which begs the question. Why don't they drop Tizen and use Android Wear instead.  Prior to the update I could wear the watch and leave the Android phone at home after solving the issue of the nagging Bluetooth connectivity issue. I don't use the Android for anything but managing the Frontier anyway. There's just no way the watch will perform other than like a dumb watch if it isn't connected to Android via Bluetooth. I still want to monitor things like steps etc and connect via Wi-Fi. As soon as the watch is disconnected from the phone via the Galaxy Wearable app within 10 minutes it's nagging to be connected via Bluetotth evey 10 minutes again. This is no good to me at work where we are required to leave our phones switched off in lockers, and it gets a PITA carrying 2 phones around all the time as well. Samsung need to sort this out and give us the option to use the watch without the need for a 24/7 Bluetooth connection."

I tried pairing two Samsung Smart Remotes to my new Samsung Q80 TV but within 10-20 seconds I get a message that the TV is already paired with a remote and then unpairs from my first remote; this despite both remotes working just fine during that brief period. Why would Samsung not allow this? Is my only option third party remotes? Is there some way to do this with the Samsung Smart Remotes?
"Despite this subject is still in development. There are some websites listing the Samsung Phones that will be compatible with Android 10 Q, which will probably arrive at autumn 2019. The Galaxy Note 8, is still one powerfull phone, surely capable of running Android 10 without a problem, but it's still not yet on the lists.  I would like to know if Samsung has plans to include the Note 8 to be able to run Android 10, and if not, what would be the reason to not include it.  Here is a list that you can find on some websites...    Galaxy Fold Galaxy S10e/S10/S10+ Galaxy S9/S9+ Galaxy Note 9 Galaxy A9 (2018) Galaxy A7 (2018) Galaxy A6 (2018)/A6+ (2018) Galaxy A80 Galaxy A70 Galaxy A50 Galaxy A40 Galaxy A30 Galaxy A20 Galaxy A20e Galaxy A10 Galaxy J6/J6+ Galaxy J8/J8+ Galaxy M10 Galaxy M20 Galaxy M30 Galaxy Tab S4 Galaxy Tab S5e Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2019) Galaxy Tab A 10.5 (2018)    Regards,"

"My issue is the sound on my earplugs. I am able to customise the sound on wired earphones/plugs, in the phones sound settings. Which is extremely useful to me because I am hard of hearing in one ear and 98% deaf in the other. Though sound filtered through the practically deaf ear is customised and optimised for me. Its amazing.  However this feature is not available with my Samsung Earplugs, so the tones and pitches don't balance out properly.    It would also be useful for this to be a feature with the ambient sound, as I am not able to wear both my earplugs and my hearing ***** at the the same time.  These would be be fantastic features for this device for people who are deaf or hard of hearing to fully enjoy their earplug devices.    I hope that this comes to fruition for disabled people like myself, it would be greatly appreciated, Samsung.    Thank you very much indeed."
"So, I am a lucky person and gladly I live in Ukraine, great place, yet there is no Samsung Pay services. I've bought myself a Samsung Watch as a present for New Year. While I was in a official Samsung shop I was told that Samsung Pay or any other payment method will work in my country, yet, it's end of May and Exynos has no Google Pay support. Samsung Pay is also not supported in Ukraine, so the only option is either to search for 3rd party APP, which might be a bad idea. Well, I found this forum, and I'm searching for a solution. I hope I'll get a appropriate answer. Cause I've been fan of Samsung since galaxy s2, still buying Samsung products as my favorite. Thanks, and have a nice day,"
"I'm new to the above device, and I want to use it principally to display position on maritime charts - a Third Party package will be installed, probably onto micro-SIM card. Wifi positioning is displayed OK via Google Maps. There is no info I could find in the Samsung-recommended User Manual, save a reference in a layout diagram to 'GPS antenna'.    Printed on the box in the list of features is 'GPS/GLONASS'.    I spent an hour with 'Chat Support' before it became evident that the operative did not understand there is a difference between the terrestrial-based WiFi networks ( range ~10 miles ) and the space-based Global Positioning System 'GPS' and the Russian equivalent 'GLONASS'. She then pointed me towards a Remote Management Team number, and gave details of my nearest Samsung Support Centre. Neither of those understood anything about the use of a GPS feature. My call was then shunted to what was called 'Samsung Spars' ( sic ), but after half an hour of muzak, I gave up.    Readers will understand I hesitate to head off on an offshore passage without being certain I can use this feature to display my position on a suitabel maritime chart. It's a 'safety of life' thing.... mine!    Can anyone here shed any light on finding, understanding and using the shy and reclusive GPS function? Can anyone point me towards any technical specifications for this feature?"

"I just purchased an unlocked Galaxy S10e phone and just noticed on the box that it reads European SIM Card Only.  I asked the guy who sold me the phone that will it work with any SIM if I travel internationally, and he said yes, sure, of course. The store is a pretty reputable one in my country in Europe.     Anyways, previous to the S10e, I owned a Galaxy S9 using the same SIM card and I just placed the same SIM card from my S9 to the S10e and works great.     Question is, do I need to make the same 5-10 minute calls using the same SIM card that was in my S9 using my current S10e phone? I know I had made numerous calls using my SIM from my old S9 and I assume it has passed the needed minutes for it to be used elsewhere abroad.     So if I travel to the US, I cannot use a US SIM card on my new S10e since it says European SIM Card Only?"

My watch battery started draining rapidly after May update. This is really started to be annoying. Each update they fix something and break other stuff. This is started to be a bull*****.

"I recently took my tablet in for repair as it had a faulty battery. Samsung ended up completely breaking it. I was told it was unrepairable and I would be offered a replacement or a refund. As the tablet was 5 or 6 years old I did not have the original paperwork so could not confirm how much I paid for it or where it was bought. After 10 days Samsung finally offered me £80. I consider this insulting. I was further told that I would not be offered any compensation for the inconvenience caused by Samsung. Has anyone out there had any similar experience, or can anyone offer advice as to how I should proceed as I have no intention of letting Samsung get away with this. Thanks."

I have downloaded eurosport player on my TV but it does not open. I keep receiving the message 'an error occured' and the only option is to quit. The TV model is UE49KS9000. Does anybody else face the same problem? Thank you for your replies.
Recently bought a refurbished Samsung J6 (SM-J600FN). Seems fine with the exception of one very big issue: my speaker will randomly cut out and stop playing audio for a random length of time. Often I won't even be able to play a minute of a youtube video before the speaker fails.    Is this an issue anyone else has been experiencing? How did you fix it? Or is it worth handing it in while it's still under warranty?  Thanks

The alam widgets are not working, the message on the watch says loading but never does, it says , &quot;Loading failed tapto reload&quot;, it never does.

"Hi All,    I noticed recently that my Galaxy Store is failing to install any apps. The download seems to be fine but once the progress bar switches to installing it stays at that until I restart my phone. I had a look around the internet and found the suggestion of uninstalling updates/reinstalling them, but this has left the Galaxy store itself in this eternal installing phase.    Normally I wouldn't be too bothered but being in China means I've become more reliant on the Galaxy Store. Any suggestions to resolve would be greatly appreciated.    Thanks in advance,  Micky"
"I have a S10e that came with a Fit2 Pro. I've had Gear Iconx earbuds that I used with my old S6 Active with no issues. Whenever I start a Mapmyrun session when my Gear Iconx earbuds are already connected Mapmyrun records position but will not recognize the heart rate data even though it is visible on the watch display in all other modes including the watch face. The fix seems to be to remove the earbuds and put them in the case so they disconnect, start a Mapmyrun session, confirm heart rate is showing in the Mapmyrun app, take the earbuds out of the case, and put them in my ears. If I go in that order audio and heart rate both work. It is as if the audio is sucking up all the Bluetooth bandwidth unless I start Mapmyrun first. Any ideas?"

I love the speech to text keyboard however my only gripe with it is that I can't seem to start sentences with a capital letter. Is there a way to correct this or is it a software error? My job would be so much more efficient if I could get it to use capital letters at the start of each sentence.

Our 40” Samsung turns itself off after I think two hours of viewing and I cannot see a setting to stop this. There is no eco setting on or anything similar so not sure why it’s doing it.
Hi.   So I was showing off my DeX system at work. Along came my friend with his new Huawei. one click and hes wireless connected with a full desktop like the DeX to the Samsung TV. His phone acting like a wireless pad. Working flawless and everything. Why hasn't the s10 got this simple feature? I don't mean mirror link I mean DeX.  I seen a thread from 2018 that Samsung are looking in to this but nothing else.

"Hi Guys, first time poster here and i really would appreciate some expert advice.    I have been playing Red Dead Redemption 2 using my One X over the weekend, and found the blacks to look terrible.   To show I took an in game photo where you can see what i would describe as a halo which can be seen quite easily.  In contrast i uploaded the same photo to rockstar social club and took a screenshot from my phone which shows the blacks (although not 100% pefect) much better when viewing from a phone/pc etc.  Since then i have noticed that the background of the BBC iplayer to look very (8 bit) pixellilated. Watching standard TV via the TVs tuner shows similar effects, i noticed a shot of a TV program from a beach shown the sky/clouds to not be blended as expected but again blocky.    Netflix (star trek) had similar issues when you are watching some of the shots in space where it's black background with other colours showing and again blocky.    Does anyone have any experience with this and could you advise if this is a settings issue where i can change something to show a better picture or should i be raising this with Samsung? I have called Samsung earlier and all they did was reset my TV remotely and suggested i &quot;monitor it&quot; and call them back.    Does this type of issue have a particular name that i could tell Samsung to hopefully give them a better understanding of the problem?   I’d appreciate any help with this...    Many thanks!    Lee"

"I have just done this update but it's so bad. I can't go back to my old really good phone settings because apparently you can't so I'm stuck with this crappy useless update.    How are you suppose to use this phone if there is no thigns to tell you where every thing has gone or how to even use the useless update features?    I got 3 bars at the bottom that are annoying me.  My phone keeps going into portrait mode even though it isn't even switched on. <---- I need this to stop.  I can't even figure out how to even split screen this phone anymore.  It took me 10 minutes to figure out how to turn tracking rubbish off on google play.    When I use the left bottomw hand button instead of just being able to close and app. It has 5 apps at the bottom that I don't even want to see.    I'm on a fb message now. I used to be able to pull the circle to the bottom middle and the message will be gone, I can't even do that now.      I feel like I have gone from android to iphone phone with out even purchasing an iphone.  I should have gone with a less know phone maker that knows how to make phone and updates."

Few days ago I notice that the side bottons are not working properly especially the bottom one. I have to press it a few times before it will work.  I had to restart the watch but it didnt help. I went to the shop but the guy said that I have to wright the post here and maybe you will be able to help me. I have a strong feeling that there is something wrong with the watch but maybe I'm wrong. Could you advise me what to do?
"Greetings,  I recently perchased a 65’ QLED TV model QN65Q6FNAF. I connected a 1TB HardDrive to the modem/router via USB. Yesterday I was playing some video files and had no problems but today I get a message that that file format is not supported. I didn’t do anything to the settings on the TV or the modem/router. I have other video files on the HardDrive which I can play without any problems. The problematic files have .avi extension and in the lower left corner it says the format is “x-msvideo”.    Edit:  I plugged the Hard Drive directly in the TV via the USB and it still doesn’t want to play those files (the other ones are still fine) but now instead of “x-msvideo” for format it says .avi, which they are but the TV doesn’t want to play them.  Does anyone have any ideas as to what is wrong or how can I fix it?"

Hello i have a samsung ue50nu7472 50&quot;  I think my tv every 1.5 hour or more has an image problem.  http://tinypic.com/view.php?pic=i3iago&s=5#.XOGWA2i_w0M  I couldn't find the exact image but it makes sth like the link above but in much smaller case and on half off the tv.

"Seeing how Android Pie has been destroying phones since it came out, I would like to know if it is possible to keep Android Oreo on your Samsung S9+ if you buy one, considering it comes with Oreo by default.    Do you get to keep the factory Android version if you want or do they force Pie on you sooner or later?"
"Have had the TV for a number of weeks - all working fine (primarily using Apple TV box). Added a LG 4K Blu-Ray this weekend and now seeing some strange behaviour.    LG BR player - HDMI1  Apple TV box - HDMI2    When I am watching Apple TV I press the back button on the smart remote, or the menu button on the Apple TV remote it jumps back and opens the HDMI1 input (nothing is playing, player is off). Stranger still, I have pulled the HDMI cable out of HDMI1 anticipating that the player was sending some rogue signal through - yet even without any HDMI cable in the TV the back/menu button continues to try to open that input.    This is not happening with the TVs inbuilt apps.    Any ideas?"

"My 8 series 65” has started behaving very strange. When I go into the universal remote and set sources for my Sky box, PS4 and Chromecast then changing one of the input selection seems to change the input for all of my inputs.    Note: The reason I am using the universal remote is because I have a Sonos Playbar and need to join the home cinema device to the connection.    So for a clear example of the problem. I have this set-up:    sky box on hdmi 1  ps4 on hdmi 2  chromecast on hdmi 4    I go into the universal remote setup and select sources on one of these connections. I change it to the correct source. Doing so now changes all the sources for all 3 connections to that HDMI port.    I’ve done a factory reset but the same problem persists. Did some one break something with a firmware update?"
Just a quick question is the 5G model plus only?  Thanks
Does anyone else have any distortion from their lower speaker when playing on full volume? I rarely listen at full however notice that some songs at certain frequencies are distorted. I know it's not from low quality songs etc. as I've tried it with a few songs...
"So I have a Samsung Q6FN55 TV and a N850 soundbar. Recently the audio via ARC has just stopped working, still works fine over WiFi/Bluetooth.    I have noticed on the TV the Soundbar is no longer being recognised on the inputs. It used to list the soundbars name and now it just says 'unknown'.    I have checked and video still passes through fine when a source is connected via the soundbar, but the audio will then come out the TV speakers.    I have tried 3 different HDMI cables with the same result and tried resetting both the soundbar and the TV to no avail.    I have also tried unplugging all other HDMI devices and that didn't work either.    Has anyone had similar issues or knows how to resolve?"
"Hello I have some suggestions for Samsung Galaxy A6+ (2018):  These suggestions and ideas are for a possible One UI 2.0 version for all Samsung devices running Android 9 Pie:  - One UI 1.1 Update with latest features and improvements  - Kernel Updates and Improvements  - Battery Life improvements to fix any battery fast drain problems and add new optimizations and fixes  - Privacy Guard Feature    - Framework Improvements   - A new type of Software Updates which doesn't focus only on Security Updates but on the all System itself   - Wi-Fi improvements and new features   - Call Recording feature   - Screen Capture feature   - Advanced Security  - A new EROFS file system (also known as &quot;Extendable Read-Only File System&quot;), which helps to improve the smoothness of all Samsung Smartphones. It claims that the random read speed is 20% higher than the EXT4 file system, up to 63.3MB/s, to ensure that the system is not only fluid but also saves space. Plus, the read-only memory design isolates outside interference for added security in your system files.   - API Improvements   - Performance Improvements   - GPU Turbo which increases gaming performance and battery   - Battery Repair & Optimization tools  - DNS Protector Feature which adds extra protection and security to your network   - Better Updates and Support   - Digital Wellbeing and Bixby Voice/Routine features   - Project Mainline Support   - Night Mode Improvements  - Put Samsung Galaxy A6+ (2018) to Monthly Security List because having A5 (2017) and not A6+ (2018) is not fair, it's disappointing.  - Software Redesign (Icons, UI) -> make them more colorful and realistic (more on incons)   - Critical and Important system fixes   - ART Runtime Improvements  I expect that Software Updates should not include only Security fixes and improvements, but One UI improvements, new features and bugfixes. I am disappointed how Samsung manages its Software Updates.  It's time for them to give more support and priority to A6+ (2018) because like me, everyone wants to get faster and latest updates to include new features and everything I mentioned above. Is Project Treble used by Samsung?  All Samsung devices should be equal, because all costs money, not only flagships are important. And A6+ (2018) should get One UI 1.1 update in the future because it's not fair.  Also Samsung should give A6+ (2018) &quot;2019 Software Updates&quot; with features, updates and improvements from 2019 A models.  What I seen so disappointing is that Samsung give its devices new features,improvements and major changes only when a new Android version is released. Why do that? Can't you just keep working on One UI on the current Android version ? it would be better if Samsung is going to change their Software Policy and give Updates Support for 4 years.  Not everyone may agree with me but that's the best I want from Samsung and I hope I will see these in the nearest future."
"Hello,  I would be more than happy if someone could help me. I'm having problems when I try to edit my slow motion videos. I can't make my slow motion parts smaller.  When I shoot a slow motion video and I enter the edit mode, the phone presets 2 slow motion brackets with a specific lenght. Which somethimes are perfect. But in most cases, I would adjust my own brackets with the lenght I want. But when I want to shrink the lenght of the slow motion part, it doesn't allow it.  I know that for every slow motion video lenght there is a specified minimum slow mo lenght part. I took a 2+ min video and the editor preset 2 brackets for me. One was too short so i trie,d to extend it. But when i wanted to shrink it (for example to the original &quot;pre-set&quot; lenght) it was not allowed. (I even tested this on 2 sec and 2 min lenght videos - the same results).  I love makeing slow mo videos but this problem occured after I updated the phone version, and it is very frustrating."

"Anyone else unable to get pc passed though there N950?    xbox - n950 - q9f no issues Dolby Atmos works and image passed through no problem.    However when I try the same via  pc - n950 - q9f I get no image or sound even though the pc recognised the connection and ability for Dolby Atmos.    If I put the pc direct to the q9f I get image and sound without issue, but Dolby Atmos becomes disabled as far as the pc is concerned because obviously the tv doesn’t support DA.    Therefore there is is no issue with my pcs output or hdmi lead as it works fine if the soundbar is bypassed. The issue is the n950 unable to process the signal from the pc correctly.    Samsung tech support have been useless so far and it’s been escalated to 2nd line but I’m awaiting a response.    Graphics card is Nvidia gtx1070 with the Dolby Atmos app and drivers installed on a windows 10 machine."
"Hey,    I recently got my S10e. I feel like it runs warm/hot under normal and low load. For example after a simple system patch I got 38 degrees on battery and 63 degrees on cpu. It got notably warm on the back side, side and on the display.    What are you experiences on your S10 devices regarding temps. Do you feel like it gets too warm under normal usage?What temps are you getting? I used AnTuTu to check temps, maybe there is an internal samsung app for checking this I am not sure.  My old phone, a XZ1 compact never got that warm under normal load."

"Hi all,     My recently bought in UK Q9FN 55&quot;     The stand for the TV has 'Q7F 55' stamped in the metal on the back plate that fixes to the back of the tv     And the bottom part of the stand, on the underside its stamped 'Q7F 55 / Q8'     This cant be right... the stand does appear right for the tv, right colour, size, shape etc     But how come its stamped with the wrong model numbers??     I know the q7fn tv has the same style stand but its Silver colour, not black / brushed gun metal type colour as the q9fn stand is     And the Q8f stand is completley different design to the q9fn...     Also i noticed on my tv when i took it out the box and held it At each side with my hands the whole tv twists / flexes almost like bends and were the screen sits on the front its not evenly centered, theres a small gap between the screen and plastic bezel on the left side but on the right side theres no gap at all, the screen edge is pushed right up against the thin plastic bezel border     If possible can all you q9fn owners look what model number is stamped on the underside of your 'stand' and post it here?     Im getting very suspicious of samsung at the moment... my tv auto updated a week ago to firmware 1251, since update its put itself into standby on 4/5 occasions every time the tv had only been on for 30-60 minutes     And i keep getting blank home screens when i open youtube, no video thumbnails showing.     Today i filmed my youtube app for over 5mins with my phone, kept cahnging from 'home' to 'history' etc, just constant greyed out blank boxes, no videos thumbnails showing up     And ive only just learnt that samsung recently got fined 5 million for intentionally slowing down performance of their mobile phones by software updates to try get owners to upgrade to newer models.... Disgusting!! I thought it was just apple who'd been caught doing that            "
"Hello,  I have an issue with my UE55NU7452, when TV is off there is an annoying sound from the back, something like buzzing, a sound of electric voltage.

"I only have a simple little suggestion/request. Could you add the option where the phone is smart enough to switch automatically within the &quot;Data usage&quot; option , the &quot;Mobile data&quot; option - &quot;Access the internet through your mobile network&quot;, based upon your location when it detects that it's near your home WIFI network? This would save the trouble of always manually switching when I get home and back to using the network carrier service everyday to save on my Data usage per month in my Mobile carrier network. It seems to me if the security works this way to unlock my phone, then can't my Data Usage work that way as well? Thankyou for taking the time to read this."
Has anyones earbuds came yet my claim was validated on the 25th of March but still no sign of my buds as anyone else had this problem.
"I love my Samsung gear, my new S10+ is fabulous but I do wish Samsung would be a little clearer regarding free promotions. I believed that I could ckaim the free air buds , but not the case, only if one purchased the 512gb of 1tb version, really! I am as loyal to Samsung as my beautiful dog is to myself, I have had the S3,S6,S7,S9 and now 10+ in addition to my Samsung tablet, my 55&quot; Qled tv . What more loyalty warrants a free set of wireless earbuds? Stick to your base Samsung and they will take care of you!"
"Hi, I recently bought a Samsung Galaxy Ace S5830 from Ebay and it came with android version 2.3.2. I tried every way of updating the firmware with no success as I was unable to install any apps on the phone. I have recently downloaded a update file for android 4.1.1 or something along those lines anyway I applied the update via SD card and now the phone will not boot up. I am struggling to find a suitable SD card update file as this is an old phone, I would be happy just to upate the android version to latest version suitable for this phone (2.3.6 or 2.3.7 seems to be mentioned on other sites). Would really appreciate it if anyone was able to supply an update file for a suitable version of android for this phone that I could copy and install from an SD card as I cannot get my phone to work at all currently. All help appreciated. Kev."

Hi so I've had my Note 9 for a while now and never really had any problems with it till now. It will charge but it's very finicky with what position it will charge with. I've tried different chargers and also I've used air in a can to possibly remove anything stuck inside. It still wont charge unless is a certain position. Please help.  (P.s) it has a couple bad cracks on the upper left of the screen and no cracks on the back. And water damage should be the cause as it hasn't been dropped in water.)
Hello.  Bought s10e model and cant find 'Caller id and spam protection' setting in a call settings.  It is missing.  Samsung promo site advertise this function like a default one (google 'smart call').  What it could depend on?  When I had my previous phone (google pixel) I had similar functionality and this was the stock Android 9.  Very dissapointing.  I situated in Russia by the way.
"I have had my Galaxy Note 8 since around 17 months without any problems, but since last one month or so, the phone has started giving out a mysterious sound - as if you are making a gentle tap with your finger nail onto a hard plastic, or a bit like the crackling sound we used to hear on old radios. Just gives out one tap/crackling sound at a time (not a series of it). It happens about a dozen times in a day.    The sound occurs completely at random, so impossible to record it, I am afraid.    It happens even when the phone is in silent mode, with the media volume turned off completely.    It occurs mostly when I am using WhatsApp or Facebook, but it has occured a few times when using a web browser too - this could be purely coincidental, though.    I am worried. Could it be the battery that's starting to go bad?? Or some spooky software running in the background?! Please help."
Hi I have a 55&quot; Q6FN and I have a little issue with the you tube app.     When the TV has been off overnight and I open YouTube app it sometimes just crashes..basically I can scroll though the menus but they are all blank. The only way I can get it to work is to sign out of the app and re link my account via my phone and its then fine.     All other apps seem fine.      Anyone else had this? 
"Is there an authentic way of backing up my Note8 Secure Folder contents onto my laptop (using a USB cable) or external USB drive without having to resort to 3rd party apps/services? As far as I can see, currently the *only* way of doing this is by backing up the Secure Folder onto Google Drive, which I think is unacceptable. I don't trust cloud services, sorry."
"Can anyone help with this? Whenever I charge my phone it lasts for less than 24 hours before I have to charge it again. This has been going on for about 2 weeks now. It has always been on 'power saving mode' .I have tried everthing that I can think of to fix the problem but nothing works. I have deleted aps, checked for soft ware updates bought a new battery and even reset my phone back to factory settings without any success. Any suggestions?"

"Received the phone yesterday, and have updated the applications and OS to the latest available.    When using the camera app, I get a &quot;Warning Camera Fail&quot; message when trying to use the front camera, the camera then remains unuable until I clear the camera cache.

Most of the times when I insert any type of SD card it says it needs formatting or some other error.

"I was just wondering, if the Note 9 is so waterproof that you can dunk it under 30M of water for 30 minutes why is there a moisture warning? In addition, unless you exceed those limits water damage shouldn't be a thing, right?  Is it waterproof or isn't it? Is it actually safe to use underwater? Or is the fact that you don't want to charge it/plug anything into it while it's wet the only reason it gives a moisture warning?  Sorry for asking but getting a moisture warning really threw me off."
"Hi all!    There is a strange problem on the S10 whenever I want to listen music on my car's stereo using bluetooth (A2DP). Normally the phone uses the SBC codec with a relatively high bitrate, and everything is fine. But as soon as there is a second bluetooth device connected to the phone (in my case a Pebble smartwatch) the bitrate drops immediately. This results in a lot of hiss and an overall bad audio quality.    I've only noticed this behaviour when the phone is using the SBC codec. If the receiver is aptx capable I did not notice a drop in bitrate.    The problem lies definitely on the S10 side, as I did not have such problems on my old OnePlus 5.    Is there any known solution... well, except for putting the smartwatch in airplane mode while driving?"
Please can someone explain to me why my TV is showing dark colours as 16bit graphics or better yet how the hell I fix it
"Hi everybody. This being my first smart phone, I ineptly poked at what I assume is the S10e's microphone (top right), instead of inserting the tray tool into the SIM/Nano-SD card tray's hole (top left) - got the orientation wrong looking at the manual. Does this mean I might have just destroyed/damaged the mic, or some other part inside the phone?"

Alternatively I can see that you can choose aerobic workout on the health app, but does this then take into account your heart rate?"

"Hi. so i purchased this tv and was trying to play a 2160p x265 HEVC movie from a usb 3 seagate hdd, the movie keeps stuttering (pixelated and sound hangs) every few seconds. it loads fast and i can fast forward without delay, but the playback is awful as i described. the tv is 4k capable and this seems odd. 1080p content is no problem.    on another note. i have a synology 218j NAS and when i try to play the movie locally using maximum quality using plex, it buffers forever and doesnt play. why is that? i have a western digital 4tb red inside and using direct play via plex shouldnt cause any problems since the tv is powerful enough to handle it. its frustrating since i paid 850€ (in germany)    third issue is, that the apps like youtube often freeze and i have to long press the back button to close them and reopen them. the tv is updated to the latest version and is hooked up with ethernet.    Also, whats with the lack of DTS support on the integrated media player Samsung? we live in 2019 and a 850€ TV doesnt support DTS? wow..    thanks in advance for any suggestions"

"(1) Can samsung please explain what the meaning of the screen timeout function is? It does not do what it says. I set the the screen to timeout to 1 minute and the screen just goes off as normal in like 3 secs. So now you must everytime flip your wrist for the screen to go on.  (2) Why does the screen take so frustratingly long to go on when you flip your wrist? Sometimes it does not go on at all the i have to manually turn the dial to see the time, this is SO annoying.  (3) Why is there a second or so delay in the time and data when you flip youwrist. You can actually see the data &quot;jump&quot; to the correct time when you flip your wrist.  (4) The altimeter is never ever correct, even though i go to the beach to set it too see level, it never stays correct.  (5) The heart rate sensor is actually a gimmick... right? im sure it is.  (6) Why are there so many pairing and bluetooth issues  (7) Why are the updates for this watch so far apart... It seriously needs updates  Samsung please fix the software on this watch, I do like this watch and I would like to continue supporting samsung products. But if its going to be this bad going forward i am going to be forced to switch."

I have a UE22H5610AK which has just developed a problem with the sound. I have been using the digital sound PCM outlet. It was perfect. Now it keeps cutting out. I have light coming through as the cable tip glows red. I have replaced the cable and blown air at it in c?se there is dust around. No joy. I have to fall back to the TV speakers. There too there's a problem as while the volume level numbers change the actual volume doesn't. I'm hoping that there's something simple to reset? Anyone have any advice?

Hi y'all!    Just bought an A40  The wide angle rear camera it's quite blurry all around but the center which seems decent sharp. Why? Defective lens or is just like that?

"Hi everyone, I have a problem which appears to be a bit similar to this one in the US forums, but worse:    https://us.community.samsung.com/t5/Galaxy-S8/LTE-4G-Broken/td-p/586963    I bought an unlocked Galaxy S8+ SM-G955FD from Giffgaff this week and used my old nano SIM on it - worked absolutely fine. My phone fits a single SIM only (not dual).    I kept getting prompted to update the android software on the phone though so went through with it - twice. I don't recall what version of android I was on before but I am now on version 9 - Pie. The first installation worked ok (presumbaly upgraded to Oreo), but after the latest one, my SIM isn't recognised, none of the mobile network options are available in Settings and it keeps saying &quot;insert SIM&quot;. There is nothing wrong with the SIM as it still works on my old phone.    Also the IMEI numbers have disappeared from About Phone. Pressing *#06# in the keypad, which should also reveal them, keeps making the phone freeze.    After googling - I have literally tried everything under the sun- rebooted, re-inserted, cleaned the SIM, reset connections, rebooted and wiped cache partition, I even did a factory reset - but that did nothing - the exact same problem persists. (The factory reset retains the same android version 9).    One thing I noticed was when I boot in recovery mode (to wipe cahe partition) I see the following message at the bottom of the screen:  #fail to open recovery_cause (No such file or directory) # #report recovery cause is [unknown] # Support single-sku File-Based OTA Supported API: 3 e: unknown volume for path [/ odm] e: unknown volume for path [/ vendor]    # MANUAL MODE v1.0.0#  remove failed dir ‘/system/carrier/ATT/priv-app/AttIqi_ATT’ (No such file or directory)  E: [libfs_mgr] is_dt_compatible (): firmware info was not valid : '/ proc / device-tree / firmware / android / compatible': No such file or directory    Does this mean anything relevant to the SIM and does anyone know how to fix this?    Thanks,    Roger"

"I'm having a go a setting up some Bixby Routines on my shiny new Galaxy A70, but I can't work out how to detect Bluetooth disconnections.    I want to create a pair of events so that when my phone initially connects to my Car's Bluetooth headunit, the phone automatically turns on its Mobile WiFi Hotspot (to provide traffic data to the headunit) AND when the phone disconnects from the same Bluetooth device (wherever that might be, so I can't use a Home/Location based routine) it automatically turns the Mobile Hotspot feature back off again so normal WiFi connections are re-enabled.    I can easily see how to enable the Hotspot for a Bluetooth connection, but I can't see how to create a routine to trigger with Bluetooth disconnections (like you can for other external items, such as connecting/disconnecting a wired headset or detecting charging/not-charging status).

"Hi forum,      Purchased the S10+ (having had S3, S5,S6,S7+,S8+) and am pleased with it, tho I am of a certain age and in all honesty, will probably never use a lot of the functionality ....  My issue is that I cannot work out how to use the screen mirroring option ... after 25 yrs with Sky, left and moved to Virgin due to crazy pricing by Sky ... this means I do not have sky Atlantic and therefore (shock / horror) no access to Game of Thrones ...  My nephew has kindly allowed my access to one of his sky go accounts so can get / view the episodes on my phone but really want to watch it on the big screen. Issue I have is that both my tv's are Sony, one is about 8 yrs old and the other is about 6 yrs old and do not support the modern functionality that would allow easy and seamless connection between by phone and tv.  I purchased a cable (to connect my phone to tv via HDMI) but this will not allow me to play the content, it picks up my phone and will display my home screen and will replicate whilst I move between screen but as soon as I try and play the content from sky go, it comes up with an error message?  Surely there must be a way to overcome this issue and allow me to watch the phone content, I am already behind by 5 weeks and desperately need to resolve this please, with your help. Many thanks in anticipation ... TH"
"Hi all,    I have a Gear S3 paired to a Galaxy S9+, and every time an app on my phone updates, the Bluetooth connection between the devices drops and i get that infuriating 'Secure Startup' message on my phone.

"Night Mode is not working on some notifications after April 1st security update.  It used to be all notifications were dark and that was it. But now several notifications have decided to go their own way and don't follow the theme, making it inconsistent, ugly, and disfuncional.   After installing the April security update for Android Pie (only because I didn't enjoy the constant nagging of the update notification) some (not all) of my notifications turned white (mostly weather apps) and other colors (clock is now purple).  I have tried restarting the phone, uninstalling and re-installing the apps in question, turning dark mode on and off again, and turning GoodLock's QuickStar on and off. But nothing has worked. These notitifications used to be either dark (when Quick Star wasn't enabled) or transparent (with Quick Star) but now they're often white (even though System settings and Bluetooth and Sound dialogues are all dark) or some other color, on some you can't even read the text.    I'd like to know if this is a bug, if this is a case of Dark Theme not working as intended. Or if this is how it's meant to be from this update onwards."

"I've been using OneUI and Android Pie on my brand new S8+ for a couple of weeks, and here is what I think of it so far. I am aware that that feedback is completely subjective, you might not think the same.  - General opinion I haven't used Android 8.x at all, but I was a power user of Kitkat and Lollipop. Android 9 feels like a big updrade AND a massive downgrade at the same time. It is very smooth, gives me a ton of options, that's what I was expecting on a brand new 2 years-old flagship anyway.   What I didn't expect, though, is that by upgrading to Android Pie + One UI, you lose a ton of stuff as well. Starting off with the terrible, terrible multitasking. Why would you have only one app on the multitasking screen at a time? Why don't you see the icon for dual window anymore? It is so painful to navigate through that screen when it was so well-done on previous versions of Android... Is this iPhone or Android?! Another thing I noticed (like everyone) is the lack of an option to hide the navbar. Why are we forced to use either crappy gestures or see the navbar full-time (especially when the icons are terrible, coming back to this later)?! The UI offers an easier way to use that giant screen, sure; you can finally remap the Bixby button natively, sure; the system-wide night mode is very handy, sure, but... C'mon, that phone doesn't feel special anymore.  That, and the battery doesn't last as long as it should, so I'm assuming it's because of the new Android.  - Camera app What's that? A camera app that has a dedicated button to change what camera is used, but not one that allows you to take videos? AR Emojis? Bixby vision?! I mean, I get it Samsung, you're trying to please more the young users, but I'd prefer, y'know... having the choice to see that...  Also, the Pro Mode is a huge, HUGE downgrade from my LG G4. There's so few options, I can't take a correct picture (when taking photos is the reason I bought that phone in the first place). And having to search through pages of useless modes doesn't help, when I could get to it in two taps on my G4.  - One UI itself I'm not a big fan of the new default app icons - that's kinda subjective but I feel like they could have been drawn by a kid. I'm NOT a fan at all of the new UI icons - the navbar in particular. It looked futuristic, it looks just bad now. And the fact that you can't make it transparent and hide it natively is such a hassle. I am not using the default Samsung Experience launcher, so I can't really speak about that, but the lockscreen is now terrible - it looks washed out. Apart from that, I haven't much to say - it feels like a regular Android experience to me.  TL;DR : I'm rolling back to android 8 and don't recommend upgrading until every problem here has been adressed, but I feel like they will never be and that's a shame."
"Hi, Last one &quot;March 1, Security update&quot; was totally fine, now my always on display doesn't work, it only shows first clock and info after closing case, then nothing - black screen, no more. Tried many solutions, I know about changing in options from tap two times, to show always on, etc., made topic on reddit, people getting same issue. I encourage you to read, what I've tried and to discussion. https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS8/comments/bn60ub/april_1_2019_update_s8_always_on_screen_not/"

The new firmware for the 2018 and 2019 Samsung TVs to support Airplay 2 and the Apple TV app has been announced and plenty of people have posted photos of it working. But my TV can't seem to find an update from its current v. 1251 firmware. And the support pages on the Samsung website don't list a newer firmware. Anyone had success getting this update?

Hi Folks I am new here and just bought a Q90R and have a few questions that hopefully someone can help me with. I have tried to research before posting but I am getting more confused the more I read. I am not a tech guy so please excuse my ignorance. My question is I have the one connect box and my audio reciever (Denon AVR-S730H) set up through the HDMI 3 (ARC) but the menu on the TV has Dolby Digital and Digital + greyed out. My setup currently has the cable box running to the receiver and then to the one connect becasue I tried it connected to the one connect direcly and I lost surround. Is this how it is supposed to work or am I doing something wrong. I also have an Xbox and Switch plugged directly into the One connect for the low latency mode for my kids. Thanks in advance for any help.
"Why is the idle battery usage so stupidly high with this phone? It's my first android and I have no idea why android fans make fun of apple users for their battery when this battery is worse than my regular old iPhone 7!  I took the phone off charge at 100%, (I dont usually charge to 100) it was left to charge for an additional 10 minutes after it hit 100%. After about a minute the phone went down to 99% by me just unplugging it! I didnt even unlock it yet. What in the fresh hell is this bs?"
