# How to handle multiple intents per input using Rasa NLU TensorFlow pipeline
I was recording videos until my phone wouldn't allow me record anymore . Kept showing &quot;recording failed &quot; . I checked for the videos I had record and everything was fine , videos were playing . The next day I checked my gallery and all my videos and some pictures had a sign on them . I didn't know what it meant so I left it alone and refresh my phone . Once back on all my videos had dissapeared, I looked everywhere but no sign of them . I have an SD card insert but I don't know if it has to do with the SD card
So, &quot; Sound Assistant&quot; app and Bluetooth Dual audio features, are they the same thing? Screenshot: https://photos.app.goo.gl/TRCPAjuo2F6gFbAm6

Post Subject: Re: Cast to TV not available only screen mirroring  Post Body:  Screen mirroring is NOT casting. Whatever you call these things, they're not the same. Screen mirroring is that sluggish &quot;feature&quot; that nobody really needs, which is projecting a smartphone screen onto a TV. It's cumbersome, slow, prone to projection (as in display geometry) erros, etc. It's a presentation thing for a projector, not a thing you'd use to show off your Google Photos on a TV.     Casting (as in Google Chromecast) on the other hand is sort of letting the app on a phone forward it's linked contents to the receiving app on the TV and as soon as the app picks up the &quot;stream&quot;, it &quot;takes over&quot;, &quot;freeing&quot; your phone (which can still control the stream, as in &quot;play&quot;, &quot;forward&quot;, &quot;reverse&quot;, etc.) The most obvious difference is that as soon as the stream is passed to the device (a TV), the TV is rendering the stream, NOT the phone, which in case of the screen mirroring, would be the renderer and the TV would only receive frames to show on screen.     &quot;Casting&quot; is the way to go if you want to pass that YT stream from the phone to the TV, or HBO or whatever app there is which supports it. It's also the fastest way to show off your Google photos and videos on a big screen.     &quot;Mirroring&quot; is useful when you want to make a presentation of your phone screen and whatever things you do on your phone. It's NOT the way to show photos or videos on a TV screen.     That being said, Samsung TVs don't have a clue about casting. All they know is mirroring. Unless you AirPlay with iPhone. That means the only way to make (new) Samsung screens let you CAST is to get Google Chromecast or switch to Apple. Why &quot;new&quot; you ask. Older (2017) Sammy TV sets supported Samsung Smart View app which let you cast. Newer TV sets do not support it, handing over to Samsung Smart Things &quot;thing&quot;. This app, however, does not support casting, for whatever reason. The &quot;logic&quot; behind this is surely disfunctional, but hey, it's how things work.

How do I prevent an app from using my mobile data? (4G, H+ etc.)     On my OnePlus 5T I was able to prevent my phone from using mobile data on YouTube so it would only let me stream video's from the app via WiFi. This was great from me as my WiFi often cuts off from the third floor of my house and saved me a nasty data use bill at the end of the month.

Good day everyone, I was wondering,  Can skype be installed on the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active?  Thanks in advance, for answering my question!
Hello Samsung Community. I need to ask and request App Good Lock for Samsung Galaxy A50 in Bulgaria and hole Europe to be available to download from Galaxy Store?
THERE IS NO UPDATE AVAILABLE FOR MY SMART TV MODEL NUMBER UA40J5500AK. BUT I NEED TO UPDATE IT SO THAT I CAN DOWNLOAD NEW APPS LIKE HOTSTAR AND JIO CINEMA TOO.
So, just a few days ago, I noticed that my S9 started to overheat really often and it always loses RAM. Today, I saw it using just 0,9 GB of RAM. This is ridiculous. What's wrong with my phone? My old J7 2016 didn't have such issues, I don't have that many apps. My heaviest apps are probably games such as Super Mario Run or Animal Crossing but I rarely play them. The last time I played them was probably a month ago. I think something's wrong with my phone and Samsung's Device Care app manages to fix the RAM wasting issues but only for a few seconds. It has never been that bad, what is wrong with my phone? I really don't want my flagship phone to get worn out so fast. It's only been months, I have had this phone since December 2018.
I have a galaxy s10 plus and send long texts - usually by cutting & pasting text from a Samsung notepad entry I have set up (eg. directions to my house). Its so annoying its converting them to mms and therefore I'm getting charged. How can I either completely stop my phone sending mms messages or stop this conversion happening. Thanks!
Hello    My akg headphones which came with my s9, the right hand bud has all of a sudden gone really quiet for some reason.  Any ideas as to why?

It's quite incredible that Samsung would not provide compatibility between the only free, full-featured file transfer client for Samsung and the S10 series.  Smart switch is no alternative to SideSync. Android File transfer also is not. It is also buggy and basic. In fact, I have never been able to get AFT to work with *any* of my Samsung handsets. Consequently, S10 users have little recourse but to experiment with the numerous third-party full-featured file transfer solutions. There is no clear way of telling which of these are bona fide or not. They also tend to be over priced, costing $40/£40 for a license to access their complete features on average. This situation is unacceptable. I can't imagine that competitor handset manufacturers would permit this situation to arise. Can you either make sidesync compatible ASAP or provide an alternative file transfer solution for S10s.
Hello  I am new to Android as I use a windows laptop with a mouse. Just bought a Galaxy A tablet which is great and although elderly I have manage to set everything up except!..............................................how do I right click on touch screeen?  Eg. on my laptop I might want to say right click on a photo and send it to say a memory stick or even right click on a you tube video and select the url to send to a downloader - many things. Can I not do this on Android or do I have to set something in settings or download an App (which I do not understand)  Thanks everyone  Gordon
My Samsung TV 3d TV drove me mad after the Smart IPTV always stopped working  I called the Samsung TV desk and they told me that the Samsung Smart IPTV is not supported with thirtv as it is a 3rd part app  but the service worked on another Samsung Smart TV that is not Smart TV..    Possiy the problem was caused by the Wifi card but I didnt want to wait and I just ended up smashed it  and I filmed it on YOUTUBE how much it drove me crazy  https://youtu.be/BUHmF0ly7mw

Does anyone have the Samsung Galaxy s10. If you do please, either email me or message me on messenger. See I really need someone who hasn’t downloaded fortnite yet. I need them to download it, make a new account, play three games and get the free bundle in the fortnite store. Once you’ve done this I really need you to tell me the account email and password so then I can get the skin. I want it so bad and have been searching for HOURS!! Thanks for reading.

So until the other day I could simply pull down the status bar and reply or mark as read on WhatsApp via this method. However this has now changed and neither option is highlighted. Anyone know how I can get this back as it was massively helpful. It works when a standard text comes in but not whatsapp
Can't believe they remove this feature from Pie. Seriously? The only reason people choose to use Androids is the freedom, not the restriction, why remove such good feature? Please put it back.
I have no idea why it is doing this other i have noticed cpu usage is much lower when reading and when it writes that same 4kibq8t8 where i get there higher score the cpu is 100% why is it not utilising the cpu properly when reading?

Good evening all you Kats & Kittens. Just wanted to say hey & leave all with an update on the status of my home theater system thanks to your putting up with all the questions I had. Well I was trying to make neat all the cables & the like, when to my horror, I knocke over my 55&quot; QLED Series 6 TV. Only 18 months old. I just recied my new set (a 58&quot; UHD NU7100 Series 7 I guess I will find out tomorrow if all the home theater peripherals will be compatible. But you can rest assured that I will be tethering this brute to the wall. Don't know what has happened to font size but for some reason it just just up a notch or two.  I do have a quick question. I have a small room about 10 x 10 as I live in a travel trailer. Anyway were is the best location for the sub woofer? Again my friends, thank for helping the oldbroad Canuck fron the Pac. SW, less than 2 miles from the 49th where I-5 & Hwy 99 meet.

Hi Guys    I am looking to add people on my Samsung Health Profile :)    My email address if anyone wants to add me is garethquinn40@gmail.com

I keep getting pop up ads after I dial a number on my s10+
This is getting ridiculous. I've never liked Bixby.     But now for some reason when I use the volume buttons, and hold them down or up to try and change the volume, Bixby decides that's their call to pop up and the volume wont change.     Same goes when I hold down the power button or even try to push it to kill the screen. Bixby pops up 3 times out of 4. I cant find anywhere how to turn it off or disable it.     All the guides say you go to Bixby home on the main screen (which isnt on any screen and I've had to manually search to find) and click the magic 3 dot button in the top right corner to disable.     Only problem is, there is no 3 dot button or anything that says anything remotely close to &quot;disable Bixby voice&quot;.     It's getting ridiculous. I cant change the volume of music I'm listening to without Bixby popping up over the top and interrupting it while keeping the volume the same.     An app just opened up, at loud volume in the library and I couldnt even hastily turn the volume down because hey, Bixby appeared.     And no I'm not accidentally pushing the wrong button.     Does anyone have any hints as to why Bixby is now across all my buttons and how do I stop this? Failing that, how do I just disable Bixby because it is the worst AI voice / assistance system I've ever seen.     Thanks :)
What is the default password for call barring on samsung A30.?    Not working : 0000 , 1111.
I have the international version of the S10 Plus working well here in North America on T-Mobile except for a few minor bugs. The most annoying of those is the behavior of Wifi Calling.     Although Wifi Calling does work quite well, I have to put the phone in Airplane Mode and enable wifi to force it into Wifi Calling mode. I set the SIM to &quot;Wifi Preferred&quot;, which should automatically switch to wifi when I'm on my wifi network. At first, it would switch to wifi calling when it first connected to my wireless router then would revert back to the mobile network after a few minutes. However, since the April 1 update, it completely ignores the &quot;Wifi Preferred&quot; setting behaves as if &quot;Mobile Network Preferred&quot; was selected.     As long as I remain in Airplane Mode with wifi enabled, it keeps a steady connection to Wifi Calling. The moment I enable the mobile network it switches back.     Has anyone else experienced this issue and, if so, how do I get this to abide by the Wifi Preferred setting?
Can someone tell me why the Samsung S10 phone line in the USA just got a $200 price reduction, but the UK or any other country didn’t? That means it is now cheaper to buy a phone from the USA and have it shipped here, buy a charger and still be better off. Is this fair that the Americans once again get treated better than the rest of the world on pricing or anything else, etc? For those of us that DO buy our phones SIM free, it hurts us right now, for everyone else that is on contract, imagine if your whole contract was $200 cheaper for the whole contract! That means less paid overall and a cheaper monthly contract. Ask you contract provider WHY are we being done over by SAMSUNG? Is the contract provider going to make up the difference, or put pressure on SAMSUNG to reduce their pricing.
Hello Samsung I have a concept idea about a possible One UI 1.2 version for current version of Android and for all devices running One UI including Samsung Galaxy A50:  - Samsung Beta Club with other users to get Beta Preview Builds of what Samsung is working on the next updates/builds or next One UI versions- Beta Forum Community/Category- Send Suggestions/Report features- Notices Section with upcoming beta builds -> changelog & release date- Beta Software Updates with improvements, new features and bugfixes- Samsung Beta Club includes One UI Beta Program for all devices worldwide (One UI required) in all countries including Romania   - Android Beta Feedback Updates with new features and improvements   - New features and improvements   - Gaming Performance improvements   - Performance improvements   - Stability Improvements   - Battery Stability improvements and new optimizations   - Android Q Google apps support and compatibility for Android Pie    - UI improvements   - Android Q Beta for Samsung Galaxy Smartphones  Also i think the next versions of One UI should include Android Framework improvements, ART Runtime improvements, libs improvements and fixes, upgraded kernel which fixes any battery drain problems and improves Battery Stability and Life, C++ improvements, new features and improvements, ARM64 improvements, API improvements, Battery Repair & Optimization tools, Android Core improvements and fixes, Adaptive Battery improvements and new features, Live Caption Feature, Android Defragmentation Feature which allows system to load and respond much faster, Privacy Guard Feature, Wi-Fi improvements and new features/tools, RAM Memory improvements & tweaks, UI improvements and fixes, Night Mode improvements and Camera improvements (Quality, Live Focus, Selfie Live Focus, Slow-mo and Pro) and Samsung Apps updates.  Samsung and Google needs to work harder on Android to improve it because we care so much for Samsung.     And for Samsung Beta Club app Suggestion let me fully explain it:  This app is a beta program for all devices running One UI worldwide where users can get Beta Preview versions of Samsung's next versions of One UI with a beta forum community or category, notices section with scheduled upcoming builds with changelog and release date, and more.  Because why not? Think about it: all devices running One UI in all countries gets in a new beta program, Users will be able to find bugs and give suggestions, this will improve Samsung's One UI evolution and Samsung can faster roll out Android Q (probably One UI 2.0) much early without bugs and stable. Think about having millions and thousand users around all the world with all devices running One UI with their support how positively impact the process of next Android/One UI version.
In addition to the normal Apple itunes store content to watch/buy/rent, the Apple TV app on Samsung TV has some channels for networks like HBO, Showtime, etc. On my Apple TV device, for example, it allows me to watch content on those kinds of TV channel apps (e.g. HBO GO, Showtime Anytime, NBC, AMC, etc.) with my own provider subscription.    Unless I'm missing something, on the Samsung Apple TV app, there doesn't appear to be a way to tie some of those kinds of channels to an existing subscription. It instead wants me to pay for it through my Apple account, which of course, is pointless. I'm figuring the lack of this feature is a decision by Apple, though, as a way to drive more revenue through iTunes store subs. No thanks.
Hi,    On my Note 9, since applying the April 1st security patch, my notifications can no longer be silenced (updating to May version did not solve this). No matter if my phone is set to mute, vibrate, or do not disturb, notifications will cause the default tone to play at full volume. I have not installed any apps since the update that could be cause of this, nor have I changed any other settings. I can go into the notification settings for each app and set them as silent, however doing so for 300+ apps is tedious and an unreasonable solution. Anyone else encountered this or have a solution?
Hi,    Just a bit of background on the issue.    I've had the Note 9 about 7 months now and until today everything worked fine.    The issue began when I connected my Bose Headphones to the phone. I always keep it in Do not disturb mode and mute (handy because of working in an office and just so used to it never turn it off). However, the notifications still played through the headphones.    Disconnected and reconnected and the same issue happened. Thought nothing off it until I turned the headphones off and now my phone is ignoring the do not disturb and mute settings in my phone. I have to restart the phone in order for them to work but that kind if defeats the purpose of the functions.    Any help greatly appreciated.
Hi, I am studying in Switzerland. My old phone was broken so I bought a new one which is Samsung Galaxy A40 from Manor shop, Geneva Switzerland. However, next month I am going back to Thailand and by the time I bought it, I did not know that it has regional lock. I have read that many people suggest to make a 5 mins phone call. However, my Swiss sim card is valid only for internet surfing so it will not be able to make an outgoing call. Here is my question, will it unlock if I just surfing (3G/4G) with my phone?, How could I know that the phone is unlocked to use Thai sim?. Thank you
I have owned all the Notes and most the S series, as of lately its becoming more non-existent of much liking anything about the S10 variants.  My recent trade in was a Note 9, and I and very satisfied with this.  Even knowing full well the Note 10 is losing the headphone jack and all the buttons when it comes out.  Can we get a little love for what we have?  As I see it, many seem to have set expectations beyond what was set in the specifications, when buying and researching the device.

Hi,  its an old model soundbar but it’s been great. Using a Phillips tv.  over the past couple of weeks the sound volume just goes down on its own for a while and then resumes to normal.  ive checked the connections and looked to see if there’s a firmware upgrade but the Samsung site doesn’t recognise it.  Any advice would be most welcome.  TIA

Has anyone else noticed that the AOD doesn't turn off when the proximity sensor is covered? It will dim if automatic brightness is enabled, but it will not actually shut off. All previous smartphones I've used have always turned off the AOD in this scenario, I really don't see any good reason for the display to remain on while it's in a pocket or bag, a strange decision by Samsung for sure.
Text in settings have gone black and with a black background have become unreadable. How can this be fixed?

My text messages on my Galaxy Note 8 just randomly disappear. Incoming and Sent Messages. Sometimes they reappear and sometiesothey Don't. Is any one else having this same issue?    I have made sure my software is up to date both for OS and the APP.  I have deleted and cleared all all chats from the app.  I have cleared the chat cache and data for the app.    This is very annoying, bothersome and hindering.
Recently done the latest update to android version 9. Nd the way message notifications are have changed.  I can't change to have the message preview turned off without having the name of who the message is from turned off as well.
Hi everybody, what happens is that I have problems with the pendrive Samsung MUF-64BE3 / EU 64GB 3.0 (3.1) every time I try to give a new format when formatting the pendrive works well for a slight moment and then disconnects and continuously appears that there is an error with the pendrive, the problem persists when formatting NTFS or ext3 and only lets me give it the factory format, the reason for giving the mentioned formats is to be able to save several ISO.Can anyone knows how to solve this problem? Thanks so much.
I know, I'm newly active in the UK community but found a petition about One Ui created by some users in here.  It's about the new recent apps menue an it's new design since One UI.  For all those design haters:  The app TASK CHANGER which is part of Good Lock 2019 is the solution for the problem.     Here are some Screenshots:                
Hi,  I dropped my s8 from about 3 feet (it had a case). It now has a hairline crack, which I can tolerate, however the phone now heats up drastically, the battery drains really quickly and the camera app only shows a black screen with 'camera failed'.    Has anyone had this? It was such a short fall, however I guess the glass screen is fragile and must be linked to the battery. I'm just not sure why the camera is failing.    Thanks
Going into the software update and pressing &quot;later&quot; removes the notification.. but only for a day or so.. is it possible to perma disable the new software update notification?     I do not what that horrrrrrible ONE UI
For my lock screen, I change the right app to the camera. Sometime later it will change to an app I've installed, Brewster's. If I change it back or change it to anything else after a little while it resets and is back to Brewster's. Any ideas on how to stop this? I looked on the brewsters app and did not see a setting there
Network change from 4G LTE to H when calling. And most apps don't work or very slow down while talking on the phone. Other phones with same service and sim card don't have this issue.
My smartphone keeps disconnecting every bluetooth app I have especially one in particular. I did everything from re installing the app, clearing the bluetooth cache and removing the optimizing battery thing for that app. It connects for a second and then &quot;Disconnect BLE&quot; so you want to reconnect yes or no or No or confirm but it never works... Anyone had any idea?  Thanks
My A7 2018 had a firmware update a few days ago and I immediately noticed that images were now pixelating in apps (pinterest, Twitter, Instagram etc) and on webpages. It's a really disappointing upgrade. Also apps have become unstable and the close randomly or the phone reboots randomly. Please advise - I've cleared cache, updated all apps.
My TV is model UN65NU6080FXZA on 1251 firmware. Called 2 weeks ago about the Apple TV app not showing up. The rep confirmed that my TV should have it. We attempted a hard reset and smart hub reset with no success for the app. I waited 2 weeks to see if it will show up. Still no ATV. I put in a ticket #2212047910 and spoke with a rep. This rep told me Apple TV is not yet available for Samsung and to wait. Did I just get blown off?? Now I’m not sure if I just got bad service or something is wrong with my TV. What do I do now?
Bit of an unusual problem. For some reason, the ice maker will only dispense crushed ice regardless of whether &quot;cubed&quot; is selected or not. I've emptied the ice out and ensured that all the ice is cubed but each time I dispense ice I can hear the blades chopping it up and crushing the ice. I think the selector maybe the thin metal bar that runs the length of the ice tray and sticks into a square hole at the back where there is an inch square shaped fitting. This flicks forward a curved plastic piece that lifts the ice up so the blades can chop it up. I suspect that the selector is stuck. I've checked for ice etc and there's nothing mechanical at the front of the dray, so it must be the square selector thingy at the back of the fridge?    This problem only started a couple of weeks ago. It’s always been set to cubed with the occasional bit of crushed ice.    Anyone have any ideas?
Hi,    Camera issues:  I am using Samsung s10+ from last 3 months and recent April update with Night mode camera is worst and low light photos so pathetic like oil painting style is it real PRO Cameras? or Korean giant cheated like Chinese cheap mobiles. Huwaei low light phots are great compared to s10+. Here I am not comparing with dark night photos. I just comparing phots quality under lights. Outside daylight pics are rocks and front cam selfie under daylight is awesome. But, Dedicated night mode is worsened and shutter speed is very bad. Is Samsung taking care of there flagship models?    Software issues:  Some apps are hanged after the recent update and touch screen, not responsive. Wifi stability is good at my oneplus 5t compare with S10plus. Connectivity is very bad and sensors are looks like third grade. Proximity and gyroscopic sensors are working very bad in my personal experience. whenever I lift my phone its never wake up.    CHIP: Exynos  I m not sure why Samsung using this ship for the Flagship model. One plus 6t far better than s10plus in performance. Image processing is very bad    Overall: I decided not to go for Samsung her after in Flagship models.    I welcome to tune my S10plus low light photography and performance improvements from Samsung community.

I am having few random software issue in my samsung galaxy S10 plus feom the day of purchase. At the start I ignored it but eventually it led me to factory reset my phone and it has still not been resolved and since from day one it has been malfunctioning it means there is a manufacturing defect. Will samsung replace my device?
Just got tab s5e bit dissapointed still not able to connect my galaxy watch to it, another tablet now being returned to ee because it does not do what i want it to do.    Come on samsung listen to your users or loose them.
When swipe up is done no older e mails load? Never had this happen before
Hi,  I don't know if it was there before the latest update, or I never found it in the settings. There is a setting to switch on &quot;high accuracy&quot; for GPS. This has made a massive difference. Before I would stand outside to start a run and wait between 3 and 5 minutes to &quot;find location&quot;, now I go outside start the watch/run, and GPS is instant. Very pleased.
i switch on the loudspeaker during a call by touching the speaker icon on the Phone app. after some time i find that altough the icon is still on, the loud sound has gone. then i touch the icon again to first switch it off and then again to switch it on and the loud sound is restored. it is very irritating to see that what is otherwise 'flagship' phone of the company has such issues
Hey,    Got myself an A50. Great phone, and I'm wondering if any when we might get a android q beta option? If so, where/how would I update to it?

hi folks, tonight while watching youtube my j600fn went off and came back on with a black screen only displying the top of the phone (white text battery time wifi etc.)  after a while the screen would look normal but not showing face recognition icon or touch screen not working. holding power button will only bring up power off and reset. when pushed the phone will appear to go off but pushing power button again would bring me back to black screen with white text  i held the power button for 1 minute the phone powered off and vibrated so i turned the phone on now showing samsung logo started up normally. entered in password and the phone popped up &quot;system ui not responding&quot;
Hello. I have the Samsung A50 for almost two months. From times to times, when receiving a gsm phone call, even though I answer, I can’t hear anything and neither the caller doesn’t hear a thing. Has someone experienced the same issue with this? Thank you.
seem that the battery is being drained quickly since the last andoid update , any idea ? -May 2019. S9+  (It also is noticed in S8)
? have a brand new s10 plus and i noticed (esspecialy in instagram) the colors of pictures are desaturated and wrongly RGB calibrated. This issue can be fixed by opening blue light filter and reduce its opacity to minimum. But its not a safe solution, Samsung should immediately fix this with an update. We bought the best display on market and its color space is all wrong. Anyone have the same problem please post below.
I have a samsung S9. I updated my software to the lastest oneUI with android pie update two months ago(or whenever is was released). About one week ago I have been recieveing notification sound while my phone is set to vibrate only or silent. My media is on but everything else (notifications, ringtone, system, bixby voice) is all muted. However, I still get notification sound. Before this issue came up i would not recieve notification sound when my phone was set to silent and my media volume was on. This issue is very annoying especially when i have class. I went to a walk in samsung support store. But they could not give me a good solution besides wiping my device completely or going through each application and setting it to silent.
Hi All  Since May's software update I can not make or receive phone calls, tried everything.....help
I am facing issue with Samsung Tab A 10.5 Keyboard. while using the tablet in landscape mode, I am not able to write and keyboard coming and disappering. Due to disappear of Keyboard not able to write anything.    Kindly look into this issue
I have a Galaxy s10e with a contact that is in my work google account that I need to move to my personal google account. I see no way to edit this from the Edit Contact UI. It shows the location at the top of the editing screen, but I don't see a way to change the location. I know I could just delete the contact and save it under the correct account, but in previous versions of Android/Samsung Experience, I was able to change the account the contact was in after the fact.     Note: I'm not looking to change the default location, just the location for this one contact.     Thanks in advance!
This only started 2 days ago but it is infuriating and making me consider a factory reset. Regardless on whether silent, vibrate or sound notifications is selected, a notification chime will always play when a notification comes through. This also bypasses do not disturb mode, making me even more confused. Very likely a glitch and interrupts all videos and such making it extremely annoying, and cannot find any other examples of this online either. Please tell me if i am being stupid to fix this.  Samsung S9 running newest OS
Hi All, My Samsung galaxy S9+ has become useless for calls after updating software to Security patch level 01 May 2019 today. Patch version G965FXXU4CSE3 / G965FOTF4CSE1 / G965FXXU4CSE1. Can hear calls, but when press/slide receive button then it disconnects., though call is still showing active at caller end.     Any help please?
Now that Samsung internet has inexplicably removed the video history option, are there any other browser options that let you view, and download, your history?
Hi Community,  i understand that Amazon Music app is supported in the US for streaming to multiroom speakers, but not in the UK.     If i change my location in the Multiroom app settings from 'auto' to 'US', i can see Amazon music as a source.     Does changing the location have any adverse effects on the app - does it even work to allow Amazon music to a source for multiroom speakers?     Any update on adding UK support anyway?     Thanks
So I have several portable chargers they used to fast charge my samsung devices one day this has just stopped and they only cable charge. I have an s6 and an s8 and have the exact same issue with both of them. They will only cable charge from the portable chargers but they used to fast charge.I have tried different cables and today I went into a phone store and the guy there tried all of his portable chargers and cables he had for sale and on both phones the same issue happened they would only cable charge even though all of the chargers i used said they fast charge on them.He tried the portables on his own samsung and it wouldn't fast charge either.Have samsung done some software update that stops fast charging from portable chargers? Like I have tried 8 different ones on 3 different phones and none of them will fast charge.It seems like something has been changed where they used to fast charge but now they don't anymore. Anyone know how to fix this? Or did Samsung mess something up on the software updates?
Will Samsung ever partner with &quot;Clue, the period tracking app?&quot; Clue is the best period and ovulation tracker for me and it would be amazing if Samsung wearables partnered with them because, having it conveniently on my hand would be amazing when my phone is out of reach. Lol in begging you all to because its the only app I use. If not please offer something better or make an app just as better but I honestly think it doesnt get any better because clue also tracks your period even when you have irregular periods... I really just would like to have the same on my watch.
on S10e volume up and down buttons are a bit small, for people with big fingers it would be helpful to have a bit longer/bigger buttons. And Fingerprint on display instead on home button more pleasing and then phone case can cover the home button.
I have the Galaxy Watch 42mm and ever since todays update my watch disappeared from samsung health and it only counts my phones steps or combined.  This is a huge issue for me cause the step and distance counts are extremely innacurate. Please fix ASAP!
Hi there  Could anyone help - I have an s10 plus and during calls it switches to my Galaxy watch and occasionally dials numbers meaning people can't hear me.  After replacing the phone and checking the proximity sensor, I believe that the problem is that because I am left handed and the sensor is on the rhs of the phone that unless I have the phone tight to my ear the screen switches on and my face brushes the bluetooth button / keys and problems occur.     Has anyone else experienced this problem and other than switching ear so sensor is on other side, does anyone have any ideas?  This didn't happen with S7, S8 or S9....!     Help!!
Did anyone notice a similar problem like this one:  When I have first installed Routines app from Good lock suite I was able to control the device volume for example when getting into a specific location or when connecting to a bluetooth device. For no specific reason after a while the app seems it cannot handle volume control anymore- except for media - all others (Ringtone, System sounds, Notifications) being greyed out and shown as N/A instead of percentage in routine summary. All other triggers fine. The device I am using is a Note 9.     Does anyone know what I am doing wrong?

Hi guys     My galaxy buds are faulty. I have received them with the claim from my Galaxy s10. No documents came with the buds. How do i claim for the warranty? Samsung website asks for proof of purchase.. receipt.     Thanks
Hey,  I just bought new S10e factory unlocked 2 weeks ago. Activated it 5 days ago. Overall everything seems ok, except Gmail notification!  I'm getting email notification with 5, 10, 20... minutes or hours delays, or never.  1. I searched youtube, forums, and articles, contacted samsung tech support to solve the issue  2. The issue is well known for 3 years already, since 2017 people claim the issue on different models!  3. I did and follow all ~10 possible fixes: including: sim card reinsert, restarted phone, soft reset, hard reset (factory restore), reinstalled gmail, enable all SYNC everywhere, enable all notifications in gmail setting (to constantly get notification for all emails), enable all notification in phone settings specifically and in general for gmail, removed gmail from battery optimization, tried Samsung email app, cleared all cache, etc.  4. It seems the issue so far only with gmail, other apps I think I'm getting constant notifications.  5. Please fix the issue ASAP or I would have to return the phone and go back to iphone, because constant instant notifications are very important to me. This basic features should work as a charm with no issue on Newest models. And it makes samsung look very bad if it doesn't. Especially if customers are not happy, unhappiness will spread everywhere. Please NAIL (triple test/check) all basic features and apps that should work flawlessly in the 2019 phones.
Been informed that this is the place for me to feedback and request changes and the software techies will see it.  I did the update last night and am disappointed with what I see now, in two places specifically.  1. The home icon s have changed to unmarked blobs. I wish for the old style to be returned are at least an option to choose what I see.  2. The 'Show All' has changed from an easy to see in one place stack format to a wide swipe-swipe format. Please can I have the stack format back or at least an option to choose what I see.  Thanks
It started when I updated my s8+ to the latest operating system, a few weeks ago. I figured it was something that my phone couldn't handle because the update was made for the s10 series. The status bar would completely dissappear and the only thing I would see is my phone carrier logo on the left hand side. Then it would come back whenever it wanted to. This is annoying because I like to know what percentage my battery is on without having to swipe the whole bar down. Fast forward, I just upgraded to the s10+ maybe 2 weeks ago and everything was great but as of 2 days ago my status bar has disappeared again. I have checked every setting and I can't figure out why it's doing this. I'm pretty sure it shouldn't be doing this.
I upgraded to this drive a few days ago.  Overall I'm pleased as my laptop a Sony Vaio with intel i.5-2410M CPU @ 2.30GHz and a 64 bit operating system is running faster. I did a clean reinstall of Windows 10 a few weeks previously so I would not be cloning any registry bugs to the new drive.     However whenever I try to do a custom scan of a file or folder most the folders and files are not showing up in the 'select folder dialogue' box. The folders are showing up in my documents but when I click on a folder the files are not there. Strangely the only folder showing in the downloads folder is Samsung Installer - my other downloads do not appear though they are visible in Windows Explorer.     In Windows Explorer all the files/folders are as they were. I have tried various fixes such as rebuilding my index and selecting 'show hidden files/folders'. No difference. The drive condition is showing as 'good' in Samsung Magician.  Any advice appreciated      
So I've had my new S10e for two days. I like it so far, but have I ran into one issue that is driving me bonkers. When I adjust the notification volume it does nothing. My notifications seem to run off of my ringtone volume, but use the notification sound. Anyone had this issue, or know of a way to fix it? I see it happen with the reddit and quora apps mainly. Facebook notifications are quieter than other notifications, the same way it was on my S9+. I've never had a Samsung flagship other than my S9+ that I had for 30 days, and now my S10e. I never had this issue with LG or Motorola.
Hi guys i am trying to find where the heck can i set a high heart alert after updating my gear s3 to One Ui....any help?
I would love to use Samsung pay but it is not possible due to the fact Samsung is not registered with my bank TSB
Can anyone advise me on who to contact in samsung, regarding an innovation idea that would save many lives and injuries per year worldwide. I have been working on this project for over a year, done my research and found that no mobile phone maker has applied this into the operation of their phones. This application would be an asset for samsung and could be made to be expanded in other areas. Please, please help. Michael Matthews.
Hi all,     I was wondering if there was any info on the launch of the Samsung Galaxy A80? It should have launched across the European continent on the 29th May, but I cannot find any info on it, nor can I obtain the handset from any retailers (including Samsung).     Does anyone have any info on when it will be available in the UK?
I recently connected my external speakers to my TV using a digital to analog audio converter, converting from the optical audio port to RCA red and white ports to connect to my speakers. Everything seemed to be working great until I decided to watch Netflix, and my external speakers just stopped outputting sound. if I use the TV speakers there is sound.  funny thing is, even after I exited Netflix, The speakers still didn't work, until I switched from the settings to the TV's speakers and back to the external one when outside of the Netflix app.  The only way I found to make the speakers work in Netflix was to go to settings, sound, expert settings, and change Digital Output Audio Format from Dolby Digital to PCM, but this resulted in lower audio quality.  Is there any way to use my external speakers with the Dolby Digital format in Netflix?  Thanks  My TV: Samsung 55 inch 4K UE55NU7400   
So when my claim was approved i got an email that it will take up to 30 days for them to be dispatched and i will receive an email when that are. After that month i received an email that it will be dispatched in next 10 working days at the very latest. Deadline came and still no buds or any kind of emails of whats happening with them. Does anyone have the same issue ?
I -- and judging from posts in various fora on the web, a lot of other customers -- experience lip sync issues with 5.1 surround sound input on the Q90R (firmware v1066).     Specifically, I experience this on TV channels that are broadcast with 5.1 sound, but not on TV channels that are broadcast with only stereo sound.     This means that I can watch a show on one TV channel with the (stereo) sound and picture in perfect sync, and then simply change channel to another TV channel to experience a mismatch between the (surround) sound and picture. Switching back to the first TV channel, the (stereo) sound and picture is again in perfect sync. So lame     The lip sync issues are present using the Q90R built-in speakers as well as with a Sonos Amp -- however, again, only with 5.1 TV channels, which also means that I cannot use the options for adding a general delay on the sound/picture as that, while perhaps fixing the 5.1 TV channels, will simply shift the issue to the stereo TV channels.     @Samsung: Needless to say, having such issues on a flagship model is really bad.. What are the plans for fixing this (expectedly, through a firmware update to get the TV to process 5.1 sound input properly)?
Hi!     I just purchased a new Galaxy Fit e activity watch. I tried to connect it to my iPhone 7, and although it does find the watch and seemingly connects with it, the app I have (Galaxy Fit) isn’t able to detect it nearby. I have the newsr updated version of ios so that shouldn’t be a problem.     Also was wondering whether i’m just blind or what, but I was unable to find the app the watch itself is demanding (Galaxy Wearable) from the App Store. That’s why I currently have the Galaxy Fit app, though it isn’t really working for me either.     Thank you for all the help in advance!
Hi.   I'm considering this watch and monitoring swimming activities is an important issue for me (Im doing it right now with a TomTom), any experience regarding the Samsung Watch Active accuracy recording the number of laps?  Thanks in advance. 
Hi,      i just got my phone a week ago (White unlocked S10+ Exynos) . i noticed that the battery life isn't that good.     My phone was charged 100% at 7hr30 in the normal and by 8hr00 it was already down to 96% with light usage of social media. and by 8hr45 it was at 90% with only 30 mins SOT.     i removed all the widgets i installed on the home screen.      Is this normal behavior?      Thanks.

Hi,  I was just wondering if I use gear fit 2, does my phone also count the steps at the same time? Or is it like once I start using the gear fit 2, my phone will stop counting steps?     I'll be very glad if someone replies. Thanks
Not sure if I have the right place for this discussion post but it seemed most relevant.  I have a j6 and can connect to my 2011 Nissan qashqai for calls via bluetooth but cannot figure out how to stream music. In the bluetooth options when connected to my car it says connected for calls only
Hello since I bought my A50 (yesterday) I have a weird bug/issue:  When the screen is turned off and I press randomly with my fingers on the screen it turns on to lock screen, same happens if i hold my phone in my hand on another position.  Please Samsung fix this bug/issue with a fix update  This happens randomly and most of the time
Turned Apps button on and now can't turn it off. Slider goes grey. After closing Home screen settings it goes blue again by it self. And Apps button is not disappearing from home home screen.   
I am having a strange issue with the Samsung Email client. I have version 6.0.02.12 on Galaxy S10+ with the latest OS version from T-mobile ( May 1st security patch level)     Within the email app when I click on any folder within the area that shows the pre-defined managed folder list it works fine. I can access that folder and see all my email. When I click on the same folder or any other folder that shows up in the All folders area - it doesn't do anything, doesn't switch over to the folder I click on. The same behavior is for an EAS account, Gmail and Outlook - so its not limited to sync type IMAP/POP/EAS etc.     Any pointers? I have done the usual clear cache, clear data, delete re-add account etc.     Thanks.
I tried to download apps from the smart hub but it says that this function is not supported, the same apps use to work before .     Please advise

The pie update is the worst update ever. Just saying
I appear to be having big delays in receiving texts and notifications on my unlocked S10 Plus. The issue doesn't appear to be my carrier (Three) as my partner receives texts from me and he's on the same network, but every day now I'm having big delays in receiving texts, e.g. I didn't get my partner's good morning text until 6pm!     Is anyone else having this issue?
Hi, After the latest update (today), when staring a run, it does not give a chance for the gps to lock location before you start running? Before the update, you could click &quot;start&quot; once location had been found, now it starts timing the run etc before it has found location. So you could be running for a few minutes before location is found!!
Since the last update, my Gear S3 Frontier is no longer a selection in the step tracker in Samsung Health. All I have is &quot;Mobile phone&quot; and &quot;All steps&quot;. But I think it is actually tracking steps on the S3 because the step count is going up way too fast for the amount of walking I'm doing. I think every step is being double counted, but the Gear S3 and My Note 8. If I set it to &quot;Mobile phone&quot; the step count gets cut in about half.     How do I rectify this so that Samsung Health is only using the Gear S3 Frontier?
I use my headphones fairly regularly and the other day I went to use them for spotify (Like I always would) and the headbuds don't play any sound but controls on the buds work fine (skipping, playing etc) anyone know anything?
I bought a 4k TV and it has 18 months of use!  TV MODEL 49MU6100  This purple spot appeared on the screen, visible when we have white images!

Hi,  There are a number of bugs with the latest May 2019 S10 plus software update.  Android version:9  Software version: G975FXXU1ASE5  Security patch level: May 1, 2019     After installing the update I noticed the following bugs:  1. The screen fingerprint unlock animation continued to remain after unlock for about 2-3 seconds  2. I was unable to restart or turn off phone - after clicking on Power off, a user needs to tap again to power off. No action was being performed. The phone would then begin to power off after 15 seconds  3. Further more there are several bugs when answering calls - I couldn't pick up a call, when I did answer it, I couldn't hear anything. I tried to call back but the result was the same. Overall the phone needed several restarts after the last update. . .  Overall, the phone started doing everything at a lag - while listening to music if I increased the volume through the physical buttons, the volume would increase after 5 secs.     I hope they fix it soon. That's embracing. . .
Does anyone know how I can remove the Gear 2 Neo (I have never owned one) from my Samsung Health App and have it recognize my S3 Frontier?

Hi,     I got a Samung TV series 7 with HDR support, a Vizio soundar connected by HDMI with Atmos support and an apple TV 4K connected to the sound bar by HDMI.     My issue is that I can have HDR or Atmos, but no both at the same time. When I launch netflix from the apple TV and HDR is turned on, the movie starts flickering.     If I launch the built-in Netflix app I can get HDR but no Atmos.     I already talked to my set-box support and the soundbar manufacturer as well, but no one gives me a solution.     I tried with different ports, different cables, connecting directly the apple TV to my TV, resetting to factory settings, but nothing works.     TV specs:Model UE50NU7020Soft version: 1252     This is my last try, could be something related to the TV? Any setting?     Thanks   
I am currently using SM-A60F South Africa and I have two friends who use the same phone and they both got Android 9 update, while my ohone is still stuck on Android Oreo. Whenever I check for an update, it tells me the latest update has already been installed. Will I ever get the update?
Hi all first time ever on a forum but in desperation so please be gentle with me. I've had a Samsung as long as I can remember. My note 8 was working just fine until last update, I had to change and replace one of my 7 direct dial contact which is pretty standard procedure.  Unfortunately the move or delete function is now in grayscale not allowing this me to proceed any further. Spent a lot of time on web / this blog and Samsung support with no joy at all. Even through there tutor app working there magic still didn't help. On further investigation I noticed that all the widgets were un accessible. Samsung suggests a full factory reset, this I do not want to do.     Any help on this would be very appropriate      Felix
I recently updated to samsung one (android 9) and my bluetooth connection is super unstable with all my bluetooth devices. I deleted bluetooth data and cache and restarted my phone and it didnt fix it at all, can anyone help?
pictures using WhatsApp camera (1x) appears blurry. Even focused picture taken by in-phone camera will become blurry when shared to whatsapp recipient. Any suggestions to solve? Tks
Good Morning.  Yesterday I noticed that began appearing in calls through (Whatsapp and Messenger) a bright spot above the percentage of the battery. During the call the point is blinking.Is it a bad pixel? Without solution?  Thank you
I was reading and watching reviews wether its written or video regarding exynos s10 vs snapdragon s10.  Why the exynos s10 is a bit inferior when it comes to performance considering exynos 9820 single core. Is there anyone here from members or samsung employees to raise this concern, maybe samsung can create a software update or anything that can help exynos variant to even the snapdragon version of s10, any feedback will really appreciated.  Samsung S10 Exynos soon to be owner, if i only have an option I really want the snapdragon,
I have an issue with my 49&quot; Q6FN TV with One Remote. After prolonged periods of the TV being off (like 6+ hours), the first time the TV is turned on (using the remote via IR) it takes some time for the TV to start responding to commands (over bluetooth I guess), or rather the remote to send them. Like the TV (or remote?) went to some deep sleep. Pressing other buttons just shows the flickering red light on the remote. It takes about 5-10 seconds. After that it continues to work normally. After shorter periods of being off, there is no such issue.    I've changed the batteries, switched off the TV from the grid for about 5 minutes and re-paired the remote. Didn't really do the trick.    Is this normal behavour? Is there any way to make it not disconnect? Other than that I have no issues, but this is irritating for a relatively expensive TV, to just sit and wait for it to connect.
Has anyone else had this issue? My phone every now and then randomly vibrates 4 times with no notifications or icons in the top of the screen?
Hi!    I bought 860 Evo 250GB 2 weeks ago. R/W speed and IOPS ok but Magician says Wear Leveling Count = 2.    Whats mean? My SSD going to die?
Hi, new to the forum.    My 4 month old 2018 Q9FN has started doing quick random reboots the last few days. It suddenly qoes black, displays the Samsung logo and then is back to the same input - takes about 3-4 seconds. So far it has only done so while using my Xbox One X (which is annoying), but at random times - 1 time each evening. I've reattached all HDMI cables and the One Connect cable, and setup all inputs from scratch. I have not done a full reset yet, although I guess that's the next step. I'm on the latest firmware.    Anyone experienced the same? Is this the fist sign of a faulty One connect box?
With one of the recent updates the alert sound for FB messenger is just a broken clicking noise. Is anyone else experiencing this problem or maybe I have a hardware issue.
cant make or receive calls after update , immediatly disconnects after call is answered ,send or receive , initially thought it was sim card related and fitted new sim , it worked for 1 call then resorted back , tried carrier reset and full factory reset with no joy
Any ideas
Hi there,  This is a very small problem, but I haven't seen anyone talk about it on here and it is rather annoying. When a notification come up on my phone, the noise plays twice. This doesn't happen all the time, but it just gets really annoying.    Any idea on how I can stop it? It's mainly through social apps.
I have been using the Gear S3 for two years and have always been satisfied, until now.    Since I got this update with OneUI, the battery performance is not bad, it is a nightmare.    I usually used the watch like this: Always On display, no wrist movement activation, GPS, Notifications of WhatsApp and other Apps.    As the display was always one of the biggest power consumers, I disabled the display wakeup by wrist movement and so I only had a dimm glowing watch face. This setup made more than two days or up to 56 hours!    So after the update with the same setup and same usage and behavior I can get 12 or more or less.    The strange thing is that the watch is able to burn 25 % in two hours for nothing. You just have this watch at your wrist and at lunch the battery is dead.    I hope you are able to look into it, because reading something of battery optimization in changelog made me laugh. Otherwise I hope that I am able to downgrade my watch, because for now it feels like a cheap copy from China with poor battery life.    Feedback or questions are welcome.
I have a lot of photos in my gallery folder on Samsung s2 tablet which are held in my internal storage.  Is it possible to transfer the photos to my sd card which is in the tablet
Hello.  I have a galaxy watch and I have a question.  How many days is he able to retain sports activites without him being connected to a phone? (sleep, running, cycling)
Hi, I purchased my phone in december 2018, and got my update for Pie when it came out but the Russian version, (probably because the seller imported it from Russia) and im from Croatia. So I updated it in February to Pie but I was getting a message that I need to reset my phone because I switched carriers. So after i reset it, my CSC changed to SEE, and since then i got no software update and no security update, but I found online that Samsung released a few updates since then even for SEE region. Does anyone know what to do and is it a bug or is it normal? Thank you.
Hello,  I'm trying to login to any European Samsung website like  - www.samsung.com/uk/  - www.samsung.com/de/  - www.samsung.com/it/  and after I login with my credentials or with google, I'm sent back to the homepage (e.g. shop.samsung.com/uk/) and the result is that I'm not logged in, no error or message telling about any problem. Deleting cookie, changing browser or even device (both pc and mobile phone) doesn't solve the problem, so it has to be some server side issue .  Actually I can login only if I do it in  - www.samsung.com/us/  - account.samsung.com  probably those systems are using a different login mechanism.  Last time that I had to buy something on the samsung portal I had to do it like a non registered user, providing the same email that I have linked to the non accessible account.  I tried to contact the customer services by email but they just said that I'm the only one with this problem and so they can't do anything, not even forward it to the right support team, I don't think is a type of answer that Samsung should give to somebody who bought TVs, mobile phones, gridges, etc for years and years.  I hope any of you could help me to solve this problem or to escalate it to the right people.  Thanks,  Angelo
Hi    I bought a new Galaxy Tab S5e to replace my old Tab 5, to use as a navigation tablet on my boat. However, this is another proof that the network card / tablet has many problems, because connecting this tablet to my AIS with WiFi simply doesn't work. See my video on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQwG5bjHq5w, where you can see that the old Tab E workd flawlessly, but the new S5e drops packages all the time.  I sent it to the &quot;so called&quot; support, but they just sent it back as &quot;working&quot;. Of course, it's ok to loose some packages when only browsing the internet, or even watching videos. However, for critical apps like this, it's crucial that it works 100%.  Or would you trust this as a navigation tablet? Not if you care about your boat.    Staffan
Hey. My Samsung is somehow connected to my daughters Samsung. When I receive a message...my daughter also receives the message. I am constantly getting notifications from YouTube channels that my daughter watches on her phone. How do I disconnect the two Samsung's?
        https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/galaxy-themes/#infinity-O-display     What do you have as your wallpaper?      Any supercool ones you've come across? (CarlH posted some in this thread, I noticed.)     Do you make your own? Any tips for sources and/or making wallpapers?
After connecting my samsung buds to my S10+, the volume bar appears as normal. When the issue occurs the android hearing protection doesn't appear on volume bar in Orange.  https://imgur.com/a/QdX3pOw    Seemingly because of this when listening to music it is extermely quiet and mono-sounding. Even when going into sound settings and turning on Mono, it makes no difference to the sound quality.    To get this working again and to get the buds connected correctly to my phone, I have to restart the phone.    Has anyone else had this happen and what did they do to remedy it as I don't want to have to keep restarting my phone to listen to sound between two Samsung products.
I've got a Samsung S8+ and it was updated last week and since then the notificaitons aren't showing up on my Samsung Galaxy 46mm.  I've double checked the settings and apps like Whatsapp, Facebook etc are set to send notifications but none are coming through to the watch.  The watch has been factory reset and still nothing.    Has anyone else come across this problem?
Here I am on a (still) shiny S9+, it's May 28, and the phone's still on the April 1 security patch. And this update was released on April 10.     Meanwhile, the M30 gets Pie with One UI (the poor sods). An A5 from 2016 gets an update.     I don't know what Samsung is doing, I sure am having a hard time imagining that such a huge company has so little in the way of resources that priorities have to be shifted around so much, practically every month. Unless it's really left to RNG to determine who gets what and when, in which case... what the hey?     What I am expecting, though, is whether or not we get a May security patch in the remaining few days, we'll be stuck with it - for most (if not all) of June.     Any chance we can hop on a train for actual timely updates, please? This isn't about huge system-wide overhauls, it isn't even about a single new feature. It's literally only Android's security patches. For a phone that's still flagship tier, at that.
Since upgrading to U1 android 9, Samsung health isn't working correctly- it goes off when screen does. I've set battery to highest I can at moderate level.  Thanks Ray
Hi,  I have a new Samsung Galaxy S10 plus and it seems to be upto date with all software. basically during a call the keypad and DTMF tones don't work, so when i'm through to say a call centre when it says please enter option 1 or 2 etc, it doesn't register at all so very frustrating. I did a chat with Samsung and tried all the things he suggested but nothing. He then said well you will have to contact our Samsung Web developers !! which is frankly quite dissappointing. It still isn't fixed and means I can't do thing like contact my bank or enter payment details during a call. I've come over from Apple and so far not impressed at all. Does anybody have the same issues or any suggestions. i'm on Vodafone. This to me is basic called but it doesn't seem to work or is my phone faulty?
Since the latest update the colour contrast is all wrong. Previously with themes the text under folders was White or at least light enough to view the folder name. After this recent update this is no longer the case... I have sent messages to the Samsung members help team and they suggested i change theme. I've installed many themes with white font and the same issues occur. Has anyone else noticed this change since the last update?
I've had my Samsung A50 for around 3 months and here's my list of problems and despite recent update and factory reset - symptoms persist!    1. The Android System USB Connected/Disconnect notification non stop after charging. This results in heavy battery drain    2. When the above happens so too is my phone screen unable to turn off - press lock button and it locks but keep still keeps the screen on. This occurs way past the time out period.    3. When battery gets low the low battery notification flicks non stop until I put it on charge    Samsung has only advised I take it to a repair centre. My issue is that I bought the phone outright when working in Malaysia but am living in Australia.    I purposely bought this phone so that when my carrier receives the 5G version of the S10 I could start a new contract as I was due for a new phone in April and my 2 year old S8 was rather busted.    I have had so many Samsung devices including pushing my entire family onto them as a b loyal ambassador but I must say this experience has really put me off as other phone companies offer global warranties
Hello,    I have Galaxy Watch 46mm and phone Samsung S6 with Android 7.0    I was using those devices so that I had DND mode on S6 and only favorites contacts were notifing me. If notification came up on phone for example from Whatsapp, Viber or Messanger so my Galaxy Watch notify me too (sure that only contact which I have liek favorite or apps which have allowed it in DND on phone)    2-3weeks ago there were some update for Watch or for Galaxy wearable app (I am not sure what it was) and Galaxy Watch are not currently working in same way. If I have some notification for example from Whatsapp on my S6 (phone is in DND) so notification is not coming to Watch or if it arrived to Watch so it is not vibrate or play sound. And this was working few weeks ago!!    Currently it looks that native apps are working correctly, becuase calls are vibrating on Watch. For me it looks really so that 3rd party apps have some trouble if I have on my phone DND and some notification appears.    If I have turn off DND on phone so all notifications are working good!    I tried reset to factory settings my Galaxy Watch, application Galaxy Wearable was deleted in phone and reinstalled.  No changes, still same.    Do you have any idea?  Can you try if it is same on your side?
My phone is rubbish on wifi and I'm not sure why...its really not good at all?  Any suggestions?  It's on most wifi I use
I have been using Galaxy S9+ for almost two years, paired with my bluetooth system first in Ford Mondeo and for a year now in Volvo XC60. All was well until with probably some update, one day the audio quality via bluetooth got pretty poor. It's a joke - sounds like I am streaming a 128kbps mp3 ten years ago...Yesterday I bought JBL Endurance Jump bluetooth headphones - the same thing...both my Volvo and JBL bluetooth work well with iPhone and even old HTC phone I have (and must use in my car separately to play music via bluetooth) so the issue is definitely my Galaxy S9+.    Something is pretty much wrong here and I tried everything (dual audio etc.) and nothing works...Can anyone @ Samsung provide a reliable advice or do I need to change a brand?    Thanks in advance

I have an M20, and it turns out not to notify when a message has come in. There is no LED on this model (found that out after I bought it — didn't think to ask after such a basic function beforehand) and I can't figure out how to get the screen to turn on when notifications come in.    The notifications are definitely there but the lock screen is off unless activated. Just today I had a message sitting for over an hour before I checked. That makes the phone really no different from e-mail, in practice.    So how do I get the lock screen to turn on when it has notifications pending? I feel like I must surely be overlooking the setting every time I go hunting for it.
I recently purchased the Samsung Q70R and I do use TV Plus to watch BUZZR and Classic TV. The issue on the listing is for Classic TV the show's name isn't displayed anywhere. Only the title of the episode. Also, no info about the episode is available but only a generic blurb about the show.    For example, instead of showing Charlie's Angles: Angles on the Street the listing only shows Angles on the Street and that's it.    If someone from Samsung monitor's this community, please forward this issue to the proper folks to fix the listings.

Hi I bought A Samsung Galaxy &quot;Tab A&quot; 10.5 today and I can't seem to find any information about how to connect it to an HDMI input on either my TV or into my Screen Capture Box.  The thing is I bought it specifically for my Kid to record his games to the Capture Box.    Also having issues figuring out how to format my Micro SD card to &quot;Internal Storage&quot;.    If anyone ahs any advice or knows how to fix these problems it would be appreciated.  Thanks
Hi!  I connected my Samsung S8 to my laptop to copy 2 videos from my S8 to my laptop. After copying i deleted those 2 videos on S8 through my laptop instead of deleting the 2 videos on my S8 directly. Now all my pics&vids/entire Camera album disappeared/got deleted. I have no sync/or backup in my Google photo's and nothing is shown in my trash. I also tried using DiskDigger app but for a Full Scan of the internal memory it says Root Required.    Even FonePaw for Android and FoneLab for Android keep on referring to a root issue.    Does anyone have an idea if these deleted pics and vids can still be recovered. Thanks in advance!
My TV model is UA43N5300AS, the other day i connected it to my PC via HDMI, and i found the colors to be too vivid and unrealistic, i went to Settings > Picture > Expert Settings, but the Colour and Tint options are greyed out, but they are available when source is TV, is there a way that i can make them available or adjust the Colours? i tried to mess with the White Balance but it didn't help
Being left handed and trying press the power button is really annoying as I seem to constantly take screenshots . Grrrrr    Surly this would be a simple fix for Samsung to release a software update to give us the option to disable the feature . As I seem to be filling up my Google photos of 30+ screenshots daily . :(    What's everyone else's thoughts on this    Fellow s10+ user :)
Samsung offers the best industry-leading glossy screen finishes on their QLED line of HDR 4K televisions. They should offer this technology on their high-end QLED gaming monitors to better express their image quality.    It is understood that contrast, clarity, color, and black levels appear visually more striking on a glossy display compared to a matte 'anti-glare' equivalent of similar specs. For those with controlled lightening environments where 'anti-glare' is not necessary or preferred, Samsung should offer glossy options of their most premium gaming monitors to fit these customers needs better.    As a longtime owner of the glossy 1080p 120hz S23A750D and S23A950D Samsung monitors from 2011 and 2012 respectively, the only thing keeping me from upgrading is the fact that Samsung currently does not offer glossy versions of their highest-end gaming monitors, particularly the new 49&quot; CRG9 Dual QHD Curved QLED Gaming Monitor.    Samsung, please consider taking your latest QLED televisions' glossy screen finish technologies and applying them to your QLED gaming monitors.    Thank you,  Devin
Can anyone give advice on the best music purchase services on android,  I'm not wanting to stream other than the radio stations I use.     I'm asking as a novice as although I do use YouTube and online radio stations, I don't know which services are best in range and reliability      
I haven't had a single problem with the earphones that came with my device up until today. For some reason, I can only really hear audio on one side of the earphones. I have to adjust the jack so I can hear it on both sides. I'm not liking this apparent issue at all and I'm already contemplating buying a replacement on eBay.    What could've caused this? The most plausible reason is that I like to keep my earphones at maximum volume at all times. This also happened with a previous set of earphones I had. What also could've caused this is that a wire seems to be twisted near the jack.    Can you please help me?
Remote RMCRMR1BP1 that comes with any 2019 qled is not quite comfortable to me so far. Need 7 clicks to switch the source. With older remotes it took 2 clicks. Progress means less clicks for the same task. Second: the so called OK button in the middle of the 4way ring does not open any menu or task in tv mode. Nor does the 4way ring. seems a waste.  please advise if i am not checking it out correctly. and why can i not order this remote at the Samsung shop ?
This is a quick message to let everyone know that Pie for the Tab A 8.0 2019 LTE (Tab A 8.0 2017 Lite LTE technically) and the Tab A 10.5 2018 is now under active development. There are no ETAs yet but at least owners of the tablet now know the update is coming.     New updates are coming to the Tab S4, Tab S5e, J3 Prime 2017, J3 2018 (Pie) too     Tell you more when i know more !!!
Hi    Model QE49Q7FAM  Firmware 1270.3    Since updating to the 1270.3 firmware the wifi to my draytek router has been completely unstable to the point where I cannot use any of the smart TV apps ie Plex, Netflix, iplayer etc. The TV has worked flawlessly for over a year now. I have also not made any changes to the draytek 2862AC router or other network infrastructure. All my other smart devices work correctly in the same location and also in other rooms in my house so I know the wifi network is stable and available.    So far I have done the following with no luck.  Reset Network  Joined it to 2.4ghz wifi  Joined it to 5ghz wifi  Renamed ssid with no special characters  Manually set IP address and DNS to use providers like Google.  Turned off UPNP in router  Factory reset TV.    After rebooting the TV the wifi seems OK for a few minutes when streaming from my local network plex server or Netflix etc and then this quickly degrades.    So far the only work around I have found is to use a wifi hotspot on my phone (note 9) to share either my 4g mobile connection or the same wifi network I was trying to connect to. Using this method everything works fine! This made me suspect there is some network level driver issues with the TV and NAT.    Is Samsung aware of this issue?  Can i roll my firmware back?
Hi could someone on the community give me some advice if at all possible I have just purchased the HW-Q60R Soundbar to match the HW-Q60R TV and would like to know what rear surround sound speakers would possibly work to make my setup complete as the soundbar is a great product in my view but just like to finish it off with a nice set of rear speakers to make it sound real so if any kind person can give me some advice on this matter I would be very grateful and it would be very much appreciated many thanks in advance Nick
Hello, my Samsung galaxy J5 has suddenly stopped charging and comes up with a message along the lines of “please make sure you are using an official Samsung charger or charger is connected properly. Then when it died i tried to charge it but just comes up with a yellow triangle and a line through the battery in the middle of the screen. Can anyone help me? I’ve looked around but can’t seem to find much.
Hi, my samsung j6+ totally slowed down after update one UI version. It does not find and does not connect bluetooth to my toyota prius plus 2017 bluetooth. I have reset my car bluetooth and j6+ both, deleted every thing. does not work any thing. a great trouble. some one should help me....Thanks
My A6 keeps losing bluetooth connections after the One UI update. Have to reconnect to devices daily. Adding to trusted devices doesn't work. Have reset connect settings, cleared cache and turned off battery optimisation. Would really like a solution to this problem. Everything worked perfectly with Oreo.
After the most recent update on the Galaxy S8 (Exynos unlocked) the camera ui has a weird bug where the viewing section of the camera is slightly lower amd looks uneven. Also the whole phone just feels slower and animation temd to stutter often. Battery performance has been a lot worse compared to oreo. I have reset the phone many times yet the issues still persist. Please send an updat to fix this. It's horrible using this phone on android 9.0.
I try to use online banking barclays app. After a while it keeps glitching and make me out of hmthe app. Is it problem to phone (galaxy s10 plus) or software itself ! Please specify this issue which I never have to come across in my iphone.
What's going on with the awful video rendering/scaling on apps like Facebook twitter etc. I know it's only a full HD screen but I can run my s7 on fhd and the problem isn't there. Starting to wish I went with another phone tbh. It's a problem I'm seeing everywhere too even the s9 etc after pie update.  See how blocky the text is at 1080p
Running a MIDI keyboard app on Tab A when you switch the USB port to MIDI you always get the fixed name SAMSUNG_Android    How do you change this so you can connect two similar tablets and tell them apart?    The Bluetooth name depends on the device name (configurable in Settings) but USB-MIDI does not.    TIA - John
My Galaxy Note will not boot past the 'Galaxy Note 10.1' page any ideas. Will not do a factory reset either

Hi I can’t find the Smart IPTV application , it uses to be there what happened??? Anyone can help ?
I recently purchased the Galaxy Fit.    I am trying to connect it to the iPhone using the Galaxy Fit app, however it doesn't show the Galaxy Fit, see attached image.      How long do I need to wait until it appears in the list of &quot;Pick your device&quot;? Otherwise I will send it back.    Note, I connected the Galaxy Fit to an android phone and it works fine. I had also connected a Galaxy Fit (e) to the same iPhone no problem. The iPhone also connects to the Galaxy Fit (in that it shows &quot;Connected&quot; in the bluetooth menu), so the issue definitely lies with the Galaxy Fit app.    I am running 12.3.1
The new phone was driving me mad and because the glitch was in the Google play app it was affecting other apps too. I had to get onto Samsung Tech three times to take remote control of my phone and each time they delved deeper until yesterday the problem was rectified without having to do the factory reset. I would very much recommend getting their help as I would never have worked this one out on my own as it was a glitch that occurred during the last update. Samsung Stars are a very good option if you need help and they are very friendly too.
At the time being I'm using the galaxy M20. The status bar only shows wifi/mobile date connection and signal connection. If bluetooth, gps or silent mode is activated, no icon of it is shown in the status bar. When an alarm has been set, it doesn't show up either in the status bar.    When I slide from the top to down below to open the notification window and such, I do can see those icons activated on the top right of the screen. When I close the notification window again, they don't show up on the status bar. I just want the icons to show up on the status bar all the time so I don't have to slide down from the top every time to be certain that silent mode is activated, bluetooth and gps are on/off, alarms are actually set etc etc.    The phone runs on android 8.1. Good lock has not been installed so can't be the cause of this. All notifications has ben set on, and the setting for the status bar only allows me to show the battery percentage in the status bar.    What could be the cause of this?
Hi, my phone will not connect to my car using the cable. All it does is charges the phone. I've bought 4 new cables and tried everything to fix this, but for some reason the phone does not recognise any other USB device its connected to and will only charge. I've checked all settings and have made sure it's set it transferring data, tired USB debugging but nothing seems to be working. What's next? The car is brand new and tried my wife's iPhone and that works straight away so no issues with the car. Any help would be appreciated.
Hi i am new Samsung user, I have brand new Galaxy Fit band and steps are way off. I did around 300 steps around apartment thi morning but Fit measured over 1400 steps, that is way way off. Any suggestions.
Yesterday I had perhaps 80% storage used on my S9 on Android Pie.     This morning I had a storage warning saying I've used 99%. Which means several gigs of data have appeared from nowhere.     My phone was in flight mode all night, so what has happened?     Was the update to the Galaxy Store several gigs in size?!     Also concerned as I'm currently roaming. Whatever has filled up my storage may well have rinsed my data. ??
My gear sport did a software update approximately 2 weeks ago. I am a runner who often runs 5ks. I have a particular running trail that I use often. I used this trail so often that I know exactly how far a 5k is. Before the update, my watch tracked the mileage accurately. After the update, my watch does not track the mileage accurately. Every time I run a 5k (3.1 miles), it says that I only ran 2.6 miles. How do I fix this?
So I have had my gear sport for nearly a year. I usually have my samsung health app set to only count steps on my gear sport because I wear it all the time except when I am showering (that is when I charge it.) All of a sudden, this afternoon it switched to &quot;all steps&quot; on its own. Problem is that this makes it double count the steps when I have my phone on me. My gear sport has only 6800 steps on it. But my app says 9700 steps. And I only took my watch off in the shower so the 6800 steps is accurate. When I try to switch the app from &quot;all steps&quot; to my wearable device, the gear sport no longer shows up as an option. The only options are &quot;all steps,&quot; &quot;mobile phone,&quot; or &quot;gearfit 2.&quot; I haven't used my gearfit 2 for a year. I am a health and wellness coach so I would really like my app to be accurate. How do I fix this?

Hi Community,    I was unable to use Smart View for my Samsung TV like many others. Finally I found and fixed the problem in the program. And now, it's available for everyone.    Download link (Windows) :  https://drive.google.com/open?id=1eouwnLiWRKfTKkZO8kfRyQLpehXV2ZGP    If you have any trouble, just drop a mail: ban.j.zoltan@gmail.com    Cheers,Z
Has anyone else had issues connecting to TV via AirPlay2 using Apple devices?  I'm running the most recent iOS / Mac OS (Mojave) and the firmware on the TV is up to date (version 1201).  With regard to tuning, no Freeview HD channels..? I thought it had DVB-T2 HD built in?!  Highly frustrating for their top of the line product to be so problematic...
Samsung Smart TV Keyboard not working . Model:UN40KU6300F.  Onscreen Keyboard appears when I open the Web Browser/Apps. But not able to type/navigate to any characters in the keyboard when I press Ok/Up/Down/Left/Arrow buttons in TV Remote. It does nothing when I press those buttons once onscreen keyboard appears.  The other keyboards in YouTube/NetFlix work fine when I press the Remote buttons. Appreciate your suggestions to resolve this issue. I have even tried to reset the TV by doing Self-Diagnosis. But no luck.  Thanks.
Is there a way to disable charing icon in last software update number R810XXU1CSD6, One UI version 1.0? It is a little bit annoying when charging at night.
According to the WWE website, my television (55&quot; RU7100 HDR Smart 4K TV [UE55RU7100KXXU])    should have the WWE Network app.    However, it doesn't appear in the list of available apps. Even using 'Search' it doesn't appear.    Any ideas as to: a) Why isn't it available? b) When will it become available? and c) How can I get the app onto the TV by some other method?
I have it on my Samsung galaxy j5 but hubby cant download it to his galaxy a3. Anyone help x
We have one user that is having a problem with her calendar syncing through Activesync. Calendar syncing just stops. When going in to the settings, account her email will have a recent last synced, but her calendar will have hours since last synced. It doesn’t resolve itself and the only way we have found to fix it is to remove the account and re-add it. She had a Note 8 and just moved to a Note 9, both exhibit the issue. Looked at her Exchange Active Sync settings and couldn’t find any issues with it. We setup the Google Client and it works without issue.    Any help would be appreciated!
So I'm trying to set up Samsung Pay and I entered all the right information and it said my card is invalid like wtf
We have a samsung smart TV and have Philips SHC8535 headphones. They've both worked together with no issue for 5 years however several weeks ago the headphones no longer work with the TV. The headphones are working as we've tried them on other devices, with no issue but the headphones and TV no longer seem to co-operate. Any ideas how i can rectify this?
I have a fairly new 1080p Technika semi-smart TV. It has USB connections for disc storage, I can configure it's network settings, however it doesn't have any built in Bluetooth or WiFi. I wanted to send the screen from my computer to the TV without having to use the HDMI I'm currently using. Will either of these Samsung products work for that or am I looking at the wrong thing?    How come there are two different sites for it? There seems to be this one:  https://www.samsung.com/uk/tv-accessories/usb-wireless-lan-adapter-wis12abgnx/    And then this one:  https://www.samsung.com/us/televisions-home-theater/television-home-theater-accessories/televisions/new-linkstick-wireless-lan-adaptor-wis12abgnx-xaa/    They both have identical product codes, but the latter has /XAA after it and the description reads &quot;New LinkStick&quot; and &quot;Supports AllShare&quot;. Then there's &quot;Samsung Link&quot;.    I have a Samsung phone but I want to be able to broadcast from Windows 10 to a Technika TV.
Just got an S10+ and installed Flow on my computer. Some of the features in Flow are good but I wanted to be able to automatically backup certain folders / file types as soon as the phone is in range again. At the moment, the only way to do this seems to be to manually transfer one by one. Would the team developing Flow be able to add an auto copy / auto transfer option so I can select a folder and have it either update the computer stored backups or transfer the files over?
Clearing the Calendar Storage cache and storage doesn't help. My fiancée and I have the same problem and the common factor is that both of us own the S7 and 2 smart watches(me: Gear S3, hers: Galaxy Watch).    How to fix it?
Why does my say health app say I was walking when I was actually running? And it records a less distance than what I ran as well as less calories.
Hello, I'm looking for stock firmware (XXV) of Galaxy Watch Active. Anybody have it? Please share it, Thanks a lot
Ive been using my galaxy S7 for years now and I am mostly pleased with it (other than battery life). Until few days ago that is. It started freezing and restarting on its own in different apps (whatsapp, chrome, games..). One time it even froze when I wanted to check what time it is by only pressing home button. I have cleared system cache and cache and data of few apps that I was using when it restarted but it didnt help. I dont see any other option than reseting to factory settings which I will do later on. Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this and any fix for it?
Hi, just wondering if anyone knows how to change/customise the swimming pool length after one UI update, I can't seem to find how.  My current pool length is set at the last I set it at (24m) and there is no obvious way I have found to change this.  Thanks. 
My Samsung TV (UE49MU6179) just automatically updated to firmware 1270. This update seems to include changes to the Tizen browser, since I'm no longer able to watch livestreams on Twitch.tv.    This worked perfectly fine before this update so this is a regression and I would appreciate a quick fix.    Cheers!
Does anyone know why my camera on snapchat Facebook Instagram is really zoomed in its not very flattering and I've no idea how to change it anyone ideas??
I haven't received any software update to my GS8+ since 1year.  By this time I should have got ONE UI update, but I haven't received any update?  Helppp!!!
Here is my latest software update information: Build Number : A750FXXU1BSD4Android version : Pie(Android 9)Release Date : 2019-05-13Security patch level : 2019-04-01 Thanks for releasing this update. There is one big problem I faced after installing the update. My games are not smooth any more! They used to be super smooth, but now my games are glitchy. Specifically in racing games, or runnig games where the screen should move fast, the games are laggy and the small pauses make them not enjoyable any more. Thanks in advance for your considerations.
My Q9FN was purchased in Septemer 2018. When playing movies the videos will regularly flash a split second of white sometimes black.  Similar to as described here: https://eu.community.samsung.com/t5/TV/Q7F-Judders-and-white-flashes  Also, a new development I am a gamer. After an hour or so sometimes sooner my TV will actually what seems to be a &quot;reboot&quot;. The screen will go black, &quot;SAMSUNG Q9FN&quot; will display on the screen and then the screen will display my game with the TV's menu on the bottom. This happens every day now.
Is anyone else having trouble with the GPS on the S3 since the last software update? Mine keeps either freezing of not measuring accurately.
Auto sync music tracks has filled up my Galaxy Watch memory so that now I can't even set an alarm because of memory is full errors.    I can't find out how to delete tracks. How do I do this?    Also, can I limit the amount of memory Auto Sync uses for music tracks?
Hi All    4hours ago I went on a 3.76mile lunchtime walk, which was 7275 steps.    Now when I look at the the S-Health home page it says I have only done a total of 5592 steps today. How can this be possible? What's going wrong os it me or is the Samsung Health app incapable of some simple maths?    The steps are recorded on my Galaxy S7. I dont have a smart watch, so no issue with comunication. In anycase the app already knows Ive done an activity of over 7000 steps, so theres no excuse for getting the total step count less than the activity. As you can see my walking speed averaged 3.7mph, so its not like i was wandering around slowly ar anything.  Any ideas whats going wrong?  With the other steps that I've done today I should be at around 8000, now having made the effort to go out at luch time I still need to go out this evening. What's more I'm 3000 steps down in the June Challenge.
Their update on the 15th of May rendered the expensive clear view case useless for many of us. Samsung support suggest basically resetting the phone to factory settings - but wouldn't that just mean the same faulty update would be pushed to the phone again?    Is it not better if they actually come out with a fix to address the disasterous update of May 15th which made clear view not work at all, and also if AOD is on, it sets my phone's theme to black every single time.    It's infuriating.        --    Edit: Well I feel like a complete plonker now. Just checked and there was an update released in the last day or so and my phone is back to normal. Thanks.
Hello,  Could you please help me, I have purchased unlocked Samsung J6+ in Serbia, and sent it to Australia to a friend. Now she is not able to activate SIM cards. The device is working perfectly without SIMs, but with them in it, the device is showing this info: &quot;SIM network unlock PIN: ____&quot; offering two buttons: unlock and dismiss.  Can we somehow unblock it from Australia, or she should return the device to Serbia for unblocking?  Thanks in advance for answer and help.

We bought a new Samsung RF24HSESBSR fridge/freezer a few weeks ago, but it had a coolant leak that meant the freezer couldn't work as intended. We got a replacement a few days ago, and being extra cautious, I have been monitoring the temps. It seems the temperatures being read by the fridge don't match what standalone thermometers are reading. This morning the fridge was saying -22ºC for the freezer and 1ºC for the fridge, but my thermometers said -19.5ºC and 6ºC. When I turned the power off for 30 seconds to reset the fridge, suddenly the fridge readings match the thermometers. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIqmdtPDqXQ Left it overnight on Friday, and was shocked to find the temperature swing between -20ºC and +1ºC in the freezer:https://imgur.com/7k1S91A This resulted in a box of ice-creams melting and then re-freezing. This morning I reset the fridge again at the plug, and suddenly the freezer temperature read -5ºC when it was reading -22ºC beforehand.https://imgur.com/IxgLYuj Has anyone experienced similar? Why would the readouts on the fridge not always match the actual internal temps? A friend of mine has a similar model (RF23) and he tested the temperatures and the cycles were -18ºC and -21ºC, which I would expect, but mine has massive temperature variances. I also tested a cheap £100 under-counter freezer I bought 5 years ago and it only had a variance of -20ºC to -15ºC, I don't understand how a fridge that cost 18 times as much cannot manage the same.
Hi,  Does anyone know if there is a way to increase the number of letters you can enter when writing a contacts name, I have a lot of people in my contacts that have their name cut short as it says there are not enough characters to enter the full name! Really poor design and frustrating, I used to be able to type as much stuff as i wanted to on my old pixel phone. Also is there a way of adding addresses to the contact as well?  Galaxy S9  Thanks
Its been a while since I started experiencing this problem on my phone. Whenever I download a video then open it on gallery to check if its working an error message failed to play video appears. Even the video my sister shared to me doesn't play either. I wanted to post video to my sns accounts but I can't due to this. Hope you could help me with this. Thank you.

In release 0.12, Rasa introduced a new TensorFlow-based pipeline for NLU models. This repository contains the code for a tutorial on how to use this pipeline to handle multiple intents per input. You can find a step-by-step tutorial on how to use this code [here](https://blog.rasa.com/how-to-handle-multiple-intents-per-input-using-rasa-nlu-tensorflow-pipeline/). The result of this tutorial is a chatbot which can recommend the meetups to attend in Berlin. The example conversation is:

```text
User: Hello
Bot: Hey, how can I help you?
User: I am new to Berlin and I would like to join some meetups. Any suggestions?
Bot: Rasa Bots Berlin meetup is definitely worth checking out! They are having an event today at Behrenstraße 42. Would you like to join?
User: Sure! Can you also tell me how can I get to the venue?
Bot: Great, just made an RSVP for you. 
Bot: The venue is close to the Berlin Friedrichstraße station, so the best option is to catch a U-Bahn U6.
User: Thanks a lot. Talk to you later.
Bot: Glad I could help!
Bot: Talk to you later! 
```

In order to keep the main focus on the usage of the new pipeline and to ensure that the tutorial is fully reproducible, we didn't use any custom actions or APIs here. Instead, we would like to encourage you to take this code, build things on top of it and keep us posted on how it goes!
